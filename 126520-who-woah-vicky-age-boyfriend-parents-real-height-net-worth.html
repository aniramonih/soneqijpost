She also had a serious online spat with Danielle Bregoli, known as Bhad Bhabie. The <a href=#>influencer </a>also faced a lot of criticism from many YouTubers throughout her career.</p><p class=align-left>According to our research, Woah truly became more popular when big celebrities like <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Snoop Dogg</a>, Plies, and Chief Keef shared her videos on their <a href=#>social media</a> channels.</p><p class=align-left>Apart from that, Woah Vicky started a <a href=#>YouTube</a> channel in 2013 and began uploading pranks, twerking tutorials, makeup tutorials, and <a href=#>music</a> videos.

She turned to ancestry.com to find ties to black relatives. She also took on a specific accent and took up twerking and rapping.
