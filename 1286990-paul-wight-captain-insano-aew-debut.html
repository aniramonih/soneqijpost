We’re going to break that out, Captain Insano will be coming out in the next couple of months. That’s why I’ve toned down a bit on the in-ring performing as well,” Wight said. “We’re kinda letting that settle down and just doing the commentary work. I’m getting a wardrobe put together now for the outfits. Max Dunbar, who’s an incredible comic design guy, helped draw the outfit up for Captain Insano and we’re getting that made now. [Does Captain Insano voice] Before you know it, Captain Insano’s gonna be runnin’ wild in AEW, dude!”</p><p>Wight is sporting a shaved head these days, so he might look a bit different in character, but he’s looking to have plenty of fun with it and says he does have a very luxurious cape to wear as Captain Insano.</p><p>“So I’m probably going to rip poor Terry [Hulk Hogan] off, but hopefully—he discovered me, hopefully he will give me a pass as long as I don’t drop too many copyrighted phrases I think I will be OK,” Wight said. “Hopefully, the fans will be excited. For me, it’s a chance to have fun to really have fun and apply a different character. The Captain Insano character is really going to have a lot more energy, a lot more enthusiasm from A-to-Z. Definitely when Captain Insano hits the scene, the party’s going to be lit, to steal a phrase from the younger generation,” he added. “I’m looking to have a lot of fun, I have a very luxurious cape too. I’m super excited.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZFxbXJxYGK9osHLZq6in5ipeqStz62YoqZdnru0rc2oZJqdp2Kxpq7UrQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./outer-worlds-is-there-third-person-view-answered.html><span>←</span><span>Outer Worlds: Is There Third-Person View?
