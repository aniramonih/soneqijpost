That being said, it is no wonder that people have been really curious about the way they have been raising their children and about some secret parenting tips and tricks Queen Bey has up her sleeve, as well as some interesting rules she makes her kids follow.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What is it like to grow up&nbsp;as a child of Queen Bey? We are about to take a deeper look at that right now and talk about the way Beyonce believes is the best to raise a confident and kind human beings. As of recently, Blue Ivy isn’t the only child anymore and she has to share her parents’ attention with the baby twins, born in June of 2017. So how is that going so far and has that in any way changed Beyonce’s parenting style? Of course, it has. She is an experienced parent now and she definitely knows how to get things done! So let’s take a look at 15 unique parenting rules Beyonce makes her kids follow:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-nanny-rulebook>The Nanny Rulebook</h2><p>Since Beyonce and Jay-Z are very busy people, they hire a lot of help to take care of their kids and their house. You know what they say— it really takes a village! However, all of the nannies that work for the Carters have to follow a very strict set of rules that Beyonce herself wrote in a rulebook called Daily Program for Blue Ivy as per Mrs. Carter. This was the rulebook all nannies who used to take care of Blue Ivy in the past got, but we are pretty sure that Beyonce has updated it now that there are the twins in the house. After all, Beyonce doesn’t leave anything to an accident when it comes to her children and she wants only the best for them at all times.</p><h2 id=let-your-kids-explore-and-learn-on-their-own>Let Your Kids Explore And Learn On Their Own</h2><p>Beyonce believes that it is very important not to intervene in every single one of your child’s steps because they need to explore the world on their own sometimes. Of course, it is always a priority to keep them safe and sound at all times, but in order to do that, you don’t have to be in charge of literally every move they make. Sometimes, all you have to do is just sit back and observe your kids learning new things on their own. After all, we all did that and most of the time, nothing terrible happened. The children’s curiosity is a very natural and healthy thing and they really need to discover all that they find interesting about the world at their own pace and in their own way, even if that seems scary to the parents at the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=let-your-kids-enjoy-childhood>Let Your Kids Enjoy Childhood</h2><p>When you are a child of Beyonce and Jay-Z, at times, it might be difficult to have a normal childhood just like all of the other kids out there. However, for Beyonce, that is one of the priorities when it comes to raising her kids. She wants them to feel just like all the other kids, experiencing the same stuff they do, such as going to regular schools where they will be surrounded by other kids of the same age. She wants them to know what it feels like to stand behind a lemonade stand and all of the stuff that is a part of a normal childhood. Inviting their friends for playdates is also very important to Queen Bey because she doesn’t want her kids to feel isolated just because they have famous parents.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=be-your-kid-s-best-friend>Be Your Kid’s Best Friend</h2><p>While some parents want to establish clear dominance and be their kids’ ultimate authority figures, Beyonce believes it is possible to do so without having your kids fear you. According to Beyonce, every parent should be their kid’s best friend and the children should enjoy spending their time with their parents as much as possible. Thanks to the social media, we have all had a chance to witness some of the fun times Queen Bey has had with her eldest daughter Blue Ivy; from cute dancing parties to wearing cool, matching clothes, etc. It is pretty obvious that Beyonce truly is a loving mom that would do anything in order for her kids to feel loved and happy. It obviously works because one look at Blue Ivy’s face is enough to see that she indeed is a happy child.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=money-doesn-t-buy-happiness>Money Doesn’t Buy Happiness</h2><p>Okay, we’ve all seen some ridiculously expensive things that Beyonce and Jay-Z have bought for their children in the past, for example, the $600,000 rocking horse, $80,000 Barbie doll, $20,000 crib, and so on, but it is great to know that even though Beyonce and Jay-Z are able to afford things that most parents could only dream of buying for their children, they are also well-aware that money doesn’t but one’s happiness. Basically, what that means in their everyday life is that although both Beyonce and Jay-Z have super busy careers, they still want to spend as much quality time with their kids as possible and they really want to be their children’s best friends. At the end of the day, it is all about finding the right balance between the career and the personal life.</p><h2 id=learn-from-your-parents-experience>Learn From Your Parents’ Experience</h2><p>It is hard to imagine what it feels like to be a parent and even when you do have kids of your own, sometimes, you just find yourself lost and you aren’t sure how to deal with certain issues and situations. According to Beyonce, learning from your own mother is sometimes the best thing you can do in moments like that and while you may sometimes simply ask your mother for a piece of advice, sometimes, it is enough just to try and remember how she dealt with stuff when you were a kid. That is the reason why Beyonce wants to be the best possible role model for her kids because she is aware that her parenting style will probably have a huge influence on the parenting style of their own once they come of age and when the time comes for them to have their own families.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=get-to-know-your-child>Get To Know Your Child</h2><p>According to Queen Bey, in order to truly be the best possible parent to your child, you need to get to know them as well as possible. You need to understand their personality, their needs, their wishes and dreams, their way of thinking and perceiving the world, and you also need to get to know their friends and people that they like to spend time with. In order to be able to do that, you need to gain your child’s trust and let them know that they can talk openly to you about everything, and you also need to spend as much time with them as possible. Only when you truly know and understand your child, you can adjust your parenting style in accordance with their specific needs and only then, you can truly be the best parent to them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=let-your-kid-be-themselves>Let Your Kid Be Themselves</h2><p>Even though it sounds pretty straightforward, every now and then, every parent needs to remind themselves that they should just let their kid be themselves. Of course, every parent thinks they know what is best for their child, but sometimes, you just need to let go of your own plans and simply let the child decide what they want to do. According to Beyonce, it is very important to encourage children to grow without restraining them in certain ways. So, whether your kid wants to be a geek, a bookworm, a gamer, a professional sports player, a cello player, or something completely different, you need to let them discover their talents and the things they are passionate about by themselves.</p><h2 id=encourage-your-kids-to-be-strong>Encourage Your Kids to Be Strong</h2><p>Beyonce keeps reminding her children how important it is to be able to hold their ground and not let anybody push them around. She believes this is a very important lesson each parent should teach their children, but in her case, she finds it even more important because her children are and always will be subject to gossip, media, and people in general. After all, they aren’t just some anonymous kids playing in the schoolyard— the whole world knows who they are and the whole world has been discussing their family their whole life. So in order to be able to deal with that, Beyonce has made sure that her kids understand what it means to be a celebrity and how it can get pretty hard sometimes with all that rumors going around.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=teach-your-child-to-be-humble>Teach Your Child To Be Humble</h2><p>Growing up in a lap of luxury and being surrounded by famous people all the time can easily affect your child in a negative way, resulting in them becoming spoiled little brats. Queen Bey is well-aware of that and she is not going to let that happen to her kids— or at least, that is what she claims and we have chosen to believe her. According to her, it is very important to teach your child to be humble from the very early age. Even though Blue Ivy is still just a little kid, she knows very well how to gracefully accept praise from her adoring masses and she definitely knows how to behave in public. She is definitely not a kid that would make a scene in public and, as far as we can tell, Bey and Jay-Z have been doing a pretty great job in that department so far.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kiss-and-cuddle-as-much-as-you-can>Kiss And Cuddle As Much As You Can</h2><p>Beyonce believes that a parent should fit as many kisses and cuddles as they possibly can while their kids are still small because, after a certain age, and especially during the teenage years, that is something that will simply just not happen that often. She believes that every parent should enjoy every stage of the parenthood as much as possible and while each stage is very specific and different, there is a certain magic to all of them. Currently, with Blue Ivy being still pretty young, and with two new babies in the house, Queen Bey has decided to kiss them and cuddle with them whenever possible. She believes it really helps them bond and, above all, it just feels so great to spend some quality mother-children time with her babies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=include-the-kids-in-your-art>Include The Kids In Your Art</h2><p>While some celebrities prefer to keep their kids out of the public eye, Beyonce does the opposite. In fact, she wants her kids to experience as many things with her as possible, and she never excludes them from her performances or from significant events she attends. For example, Bey included both her daughter, Blue Ivy, and her mother, Tina Knowles, in her Grammys performance in 2017, and besides that, Blue Ivy has already been to more music video sets, concerts, awards shows, Super Bowls, galas, and similar events than most of the people in the world could ever dream about visiting. And while some kids might be bored during grown-up’s events like that, little Blue Ivy seems to really enjoy them very much and she is always beyond adorable.</p><h2 id=take-your-kids-to-the-important-museums>Take Your Kids To The Important Museums</h2><p>Beyonce and Jay-Z really want their kids to see and experience the world outside their home. Blue Ivy has had a chance to travel more in her life so far than most of the people do in their entire lifetime. However, whenever Blue Ivy travels with her parents, it is not all about visiting amusement parks and shopping for toys. On the contrary, Beyonce wants Blue Ivy to experience different cultures and to learn something new during every one of her trips. For that reason, Bey always takes her daughter to important museums where she gets to learn a lot about history and culture, and Blue Ivy truly loves these little educational trips. She is a very curious child and she loves to learn new, interesting things wherever she goes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=don-t-overthink-everything>Don’t Overthink Everything</h2><p>Beyonce agrees that raising a child is one of the toughest, yet most rewarding jobs in the entire world. However, she admits that it was hard for her not to overthink everything when she first became a parent. Suddenly, there is this whole new person that you have to take care of and, at the same time, you love them more than anything in the world and you want to be the best parent possible. That all combined can get pretty intimidating from time to time and Bey agrees that the best thing you can do is simply trust your instincts and not analyze your every step and every parenting decision you make. After all, according to her, parenting is a never-ending learning process and you just have to take it one day at the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=show-off-your-motherly-pride>Show Off Your Motherly Pride</h2><p>Beyonce truly is one extremely proud parent and she enjoys showing off her motherly pride to the world. She believes that in the world where women want to prove they can have it all— a career, a family, a personal life, and some fun on top of that— it is important to balance things the best you can and find the way to display the mothering side of you constantly to prove that being a mother doesn’t make you any less tough and powerful. In the world where being a mother often gets in the way of women’s career as they get judged by their bosses or colleagues for not putting the career in the first place, Beyonce has decided to share with her followers and with the whole public that women are, indeed, capable of balancing both of those worlds and being both successful in their jobs and awesome parents at the same time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhpZWK0sLjDnqVmqJGnsq%2FAyKeeZqqlobK0ecGesKimk5p6rq3KnqpmoJWneqy1w6xkn6ecoby4ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bear-brown-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span> What is Bear Browns net worth?
