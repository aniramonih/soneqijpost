The <a href=#>2023 MTV Movie & TV Awards</a> are returning this spring to honor the best in scripted and unscripted media.</p><p>The awards show will take place at the Barker Hangar in Los Angeles on Sunday, May 7. For the sixth year in a row, the ceremony will honor both movies and television. In the past, the event solely honored films but expanded in 2017 to include TV programming.</p><p>For the past two years, there have been duel cohosts to emcee the night. One host annouces the scripted accolades while another handles the unscripted portion. Last year,<a href=#> <strong>Vanessa Hudgens</strong> </a>and <a href=#><strong>Tayshia Adams</strong></a> took turns on the mic, handling the scripted and unscripted portions, respectively. A host for this year has been announced yet.</p><p><a href=#>Variety</a> revealed in February 2023 that the special event was going to combine the two ceremonies and not have them take place in separate time blocks.</p><p>The show will air on MTV internationally and be available to watch in more than 170 countries. Hosts, nominations, performers, presenters and additional details will be announced on a date closer to the ceremony.</p><p>Last year‚Äôs awards featured gender-neutral nominations and introduced new categories including Best Song, Best Reality Return, Best Music Documentary, Best Reality Romance and Best Reality Star. <a href=#>Winners from the previous ceremony</a> included Spider-Man: No Way Home, <a href=#>Euphoria</a>, Scream, Loki and <a href=#>Selling Sunset</a>.</p><p>Prior to the cast of the Netflix reality series winning big, <a href=#><strong>Chrishell Stause</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>G Flip</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Jason Oppenheim</strong></a> were seen <a href=#>hugging while inside the venue</a>. The awards show‚Äôs official social media page then shared a clip of the trio‚Äôs embrace.</p><p>‚ÄúMy #SellingSunset heart just isn‚Äôt ready for #MTVAwards moments like this üßê,‚Äù MTV captioned a video of the trio ahead of the unscripted portion of the night. In the clip, Stause was seen mouthing, ‚ÄúWhat is happening?‚Äù at the camera.</p><p>The ceremony also gives out specialized honors, including the Comedic Genius Award, the MTV Generation Award and MTV Reality Royalty Lifetime Achievement Award. During the 2022 broadcast, <a href=#><strong>Jack Black</strong></a> was awarded the trophy for his iconic comedic career while <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong></a> was bestowed the Generation Award. <a href=#><strong>Bethenny Frankel</strong></a> took home the win for reality Lifetime Achievement in the second part.</p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>In March 2023, it was announced that <a href=#><strong>Drew Barrymore</strong></a> would be hosting this year‚Äôs ceremony. However, the show hit a snag two months later when the Never Been Kissed star revealed she was pulling out of her emcee duties in solidarity with the striking Writers Guild members.</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>‚ÄúI have listened to the writers, and in order to truly respect them, I will pivot from hosting the MTV Movie & TV Awards live in solidarity with the strike,‚Äù Barrymore told<a href=#> Variety</a> in a May 2023 statement. ‚ÄúEverything we celebrate and honor about movies and television is born out of their creation. And until a solution is reached, I am choosing to wait but I‚Äôll be watching from home and hope you will join me. I thank MTV, who has truly been some of the best partners I have ever worked with. And I can‚Äôt wait to be a part of this next year, when I can truly celebrate everything that MTV has created, which is a show that allows fans to choose who the awards go to and is truly inclusive.‚Äù</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Paramount Global‚Äôs president of music, <strong>Bruce Gillmer</strong>, told the outlet that while the awards show is now set to be ‚Äúhostless‚Äù ‚Äî and presenters will likely now skip the event in support of the strike&nbsp; ‚Äî MTV still plans on ‚Äúdelivering for the fans.‚Äù</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>‚ÄúThe exclusive sneak peeks of the big films that are to be released,‚Äù he shared with Variety at the time. ‚ÄúWe still have a live performance. We still have the award sequences, although those are the elements that are very unpredictable ‚Äî because clearly, we don‚Äôt know which talent will feel comfortable. A lot of them won‚Äôt.‚Äù</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Us Weekly later confirmed that&nbsp;<span class=x_ContentPasted1>t</span><span class=x_ContentPasted1>here would no longer be a red carpet or talent interviews prior to the ceremony.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Keep scrolling to learn more about the MTV awards show:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq19nfXN%2FjKarr2WdpMOqsYytrWaZp5a%2Fpb%2BMnq2eqqmptaq6xmarqGWbo7y4ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./baker-lily-vanilli-talks-creating-bespoke-cakes.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>'I'm the go-to person for weird cakes!': Baker Lily Vanilli talks creating bespoke cakes</span></a>
