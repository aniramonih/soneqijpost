I clean it up, scrub with soap, spray the spot with cologne- and of course change the litter box. And he does it again.</p><p>He's a very strange cat. He appeared on the porch as a 3-mo. old and I adopted him. He won't eat cat food; I have to buy meat like pork or chicken and chop it into bits for him. He also likes shredded sharp cheddar cheese. He sleeps on top of the refrigerator and sometimes acts spacy, like he doesn't know me or know where he's at. He won't drink water out of bowls; he drinks from the fish tank pump.</p><p>Why are cats so weird?</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 38</td><td class=timestamp><span>March 14, 2021 6:58 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>You have NINE cats OP?

For Christ's sake, do a simple Google search on feline dietary needs.</p><p>As to the number of cats you have, I hope your house is at least 4,500 square feet.
