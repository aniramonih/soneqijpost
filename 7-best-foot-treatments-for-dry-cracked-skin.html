Foot dryness is a common concern for many of Us, but when that dryness becomes extreme, it can start to cause the skin to crack. While it’s often not too serious an issue, more severe cases of cracked feet can cause pain and even lead to an infection called cellulitis in extreme instances."><meta name=author content="Patria Henriques"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

While it’s often not too serious an issue, more severe cases of cracked feet can cause pain and even lead to an infection <a href=# rel=noopener>called cellulitis</a> in extreme instances. More often than not, cracked feet will mostly make you feel a bit self-conscious about wearing sandals — a feeling we obviously want to avoid during the height of summer.</p><p>Grappling with cracked feet is an incredibly popular complaint — a <a href=# rel=noopener>national study conducted back in 2012</a> found that 20% of adults aged 21 and older have experienced them. Though they’re more common in women than in men, anyone is prone to feet cracking. Annoying is an understatement! Though these cracks may feel like they’re so deep there’s no saving them, there are plenty of restorative treatments you can try!</p><p>That said, regular moisturizers aren’t going to cut it. You need to look for rich creams and balms to help soften the skin and eventually meld those cracks to make your feet whole again. Don’t know where to look? Check out seven top treatments we researched below!</p><p><strong>This Exfoliating Treatment&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/AmLactin-Foot-Repair-Foot-Cream-Therapy.png><p>The lactic acid in this treatment gently exfoliates the dead skin on your feet which causes your heels to crack, and helps progress the healing process!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">AmLactin Foot Repair Foot Cream Therapy</a> for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$8</a> at Amazon!
