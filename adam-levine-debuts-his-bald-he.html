"Excuse me. Lex Luthor was bald," he wrote on <a data-offer-url=https://twitter.com/adamlevine/status/653751528398954496 class=external-link data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://twitter.com/adamlevine/status/653751528398954496"}' href=# rel=noopener>Twitter</a> last night after his new 'do premiered on The Voice. "I have 'shaved' my head. Meaning, shaved by choice. Big difference. OK?!! OK?!!" But whether you call it bald, shaved, or hairless, Levine's fans had plenty to say about his bare head. Some of the reactions were less than positive (some even downright mean), but most were some combination of shock, humor, and approval. Take a look at all the strong opinions that blew up Twitter last night.</p><figure class="AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed"><span class="SpanWrapper-umhxW kGxnNB responsive-asset AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi eCxVQK asset-embed__responsive-asset"></span></figure><p><strong>There were the funny:</strong></p><h4 class="ConsentBannerTitle-lgaGAH gOfech">X content</h4><p>This content can also be viewed on the site it <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer" aria-label="Opens in a new window" class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ BaseLink-eNWuiM ConsentBannerLink-dJZMSz iUEiRd irjujW csfskF">originates</a> from.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLjApqauql6YvK570q2mq7FflrGiuYylnK%2Bhnpp6pbHBrqusZZiewG6uwKWbZqCV</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./funny-fathers-day-cards-shop-online.html><span>←</span><span>12 best Funny Father's Day cards you can buy online to send in the UK</span></a>
