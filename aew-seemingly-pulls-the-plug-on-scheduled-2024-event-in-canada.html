It is a fact that the company was truly at its peak after All Out 2021 when many felt they were ready to take over the pro wrestling world. Those days are long gone now as AEW is struggling to sell tickets for their shows and now AEW could end up pulling an upcoming show for some reason.</p><p>Fans have also gotten tired of how AEW has been booking their shows for the past several months, which has been reflected in their poor ticket sales – despite AEW’s tactics to sell as many as possible.</p><p>As pointed out by WrestleTix, AEW pulled the plug on a March 27, 2024 event in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The event was supposed to take place in the Centre Videtron. WrestleTix also indicated in the same tweet that the location may have been spoiled and they could be making the announcement later tonight.</p><p>‘‘It’s been pulled, but Ticketmaster briefly listed a new AEW date in Quebec, QC, for Dynamite on March 27th in 2024, with a pre-sale date of December 11th. I expect it will be announced tonight on Dynamite. I also expect their Ottawa debut may be a date added around that time (possibly for Collision).”</p><p>AEW Dynamite will be going down tonight as well, which will follow up on what transpired on last week’s show. We will have to wait and see whether AEW will announce more events in Canada in the future.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>What’s your opinion on this story?
