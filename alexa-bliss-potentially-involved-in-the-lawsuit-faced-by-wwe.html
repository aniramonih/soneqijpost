The business of Vince McMahon has dealt with its fair share of legal troubles in the past, so this is nothing new for them. They currently have to deal with yet another significant issue. Dana W. Wiley has filed a lawsuit against WWE and Vince McMahon in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-646 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2 id=h-allegation><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-869 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Allegation</h2><p>A $5,500 “down fee for a meet-up scheduled via email conversations, to meet face-to-face with World Wrestling Entertainment employee Alexa Bliss” on June 30th is allegedly not being reimbursed, according to court records obtained by PW Insider. The handwritten lawsuit claims that WWE’s Executive Chairman broke an agreement with Wiley under which Wiley was to join the company as an employee earning $70,000 per month.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>The Handwritten Lawsuit</h2><p>Wiley claims that, as was indicated in the lawsuit, McMahon discriminated against him.“Plaintiff was arrested and charge (sic) for attempted homicide, aggravate (sic) assault against New Castle, Pennsylvania Law Enforcement on 10/22/22 order the United States Secret Service and Pennsylvania State Police Troop, D. major case team to possess a warrant to unlawful seized Search I, Plaintiff phone device and property in conspiracy theory plot to obstruct and destroy any evidence supporting these facts that World Wrestling Entertainment employee Alexia (sic) Bliss email text to I, Plaintiff hangout, what app email business accounts.”&nbsp;</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-637 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>The Compensation</h2><p>In order to compensate for the contract violation and the cost of all legal fees, Wiley is asking for $6 million in damages. Alexa Bliss has not made any public comments about this ongoing matter as of the time of this writing. Wiley made an effort to sue Vince McMahon before, but this time was not successful. He previously sued McMahon, DX members, and the NWO, claiming that he had signed a fair use agreement for those organizations’ trademarks back in 1995.</p><p>On the steps of a courthouse in New Castle, Pennsylvania, Wiley allegedly signed the contract after being given a sentence “in an unrelated criminal case.” However, this specific lawsuit was ultimately thrown out. We’ll have to check to see whether this scenario has changed. WWE’s legal team will, if anything, be used effectively wherever they are required.</p><p>For more <a href=#>WWE</a> news</p><p>Roman Reigns – <a href=#>On WWE Night of Champions 2023, Roman Reigns reached a massive milestone</a></p><p><a href=#>Cody Rhodes – WWE hall of Famer thinks Cody Rhodes should turn heel</a></p><p>Get the latest from Sportslumo.com by following us on <a href=#>Instagram</a>, <a href=#>Twitter</a>, and <a href=#>YouTube</a>.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2Ftb%2FLrqSoZpOkunDD1p5mmqSVra5ursuiqqxloKTBprrTopilpKlitq%2FCzqWtnpxdnrtuwMeeZKWZp6jCqsCMn5icnZRir7p51rCcaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./aaradhna-boyfriend-husband.html><span>←</span><span>Aaradhnas Boyfriend/Husband: Is the Singer Married?</span></a>
