Tala has designed patterned face masks – Le Masque – which offer protection in style. All proceeds will be donated to The Red Cross Singapore, in support of those affected by the coronavirus. Tala explained that face masks in Asia – where she has been an expat for over 20 years – are a household staple – and used regularly to protect against illness and pollution. She said: "I've been an expat in Asia for over 20 years. Part of&nbsp;TALA brand's mission is to make a difference wherever we can to help those in need, through fashion."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f0f47a697864-amal-clooney-sister-tala-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eOzSP60U7kNO data-wc=18><strong>Amal Clooney's sister Tala&nbsp;Alamuddin is donating all proceeds to her face masks to The Red Cross Singapore&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=e6mlLOjxRi76 data-wc=57>Tala continued: "We created Le Masque as a response to help during these unprecedented, scary times. Masks are a staple in Asian households, and used regularly for colds, pollution, and cosmetic recovery. Our masks are NOT N95 certified, and should be considered a physical barrier for sneezing and colds with flair, but they are not medically certified.</p><p id=e2i8zL1TLy4o data-wc=1><strong>MORE:</strong> <a class=hm-link href=#>Friends star Courteney Cox shows off immaculate kitchen in Malibu home</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1db594d1bd6b-tala-facemask-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=en_CNyZ0T4od data-wc=10><strong>TALA has created a number of fashion-forward face mask designs&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eVJw-9MWIu4V data-wc=64>"We are eager to support people during this trying time, so we've taken a stance and all profits from Le Masque sales will be donated to Red Cross Singapore in support of their efforts to those directly affected by coronavirus.

The mother-of-four is also selling hand sanitiser pouches in an array of colours, which cost £28. Part of the TALA brand mission is sustainability. The company has been homegrown and is&nbsp;committed to reusing and recycling materials whenever possible. Tala's designs range from jewellery to keyrings, and Amal is a big fan of her creations, including a pair of earrings designed by her sister.</p><p id=eV2ZOUFfrQ1e data-wc=11></p><p id=edMkWib_5-E8 data-wc=14></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
