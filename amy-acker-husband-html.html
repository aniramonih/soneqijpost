She has lived a big part of her life in front of the cameras alongside her husband, James Carpinello. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The two are a living example of how not every Hollywood romance is meant to disintegrate in a few years. The couple has been married for almost 20 years now.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The couple, who have two teenagers, also seems to have passed on the performative genes to their little ones. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Amy Acker’s Marriage with James Carpinello</h2><p>It might not be too outlandish to speculate that Acker and Carpinello met at one of their jobs. After all, they have been working in the entertainment industry for over two decades.</p><p>Acker got started in the movie business before her husband — she made her big screen debut in 1997 whereas he did that only in 2000. However, he was already doing theater before his movie career took off.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The couple tied the knot&nbsp;in a beautiful "<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">wine and roses</a>" wedding at the Hans Fahden Vineyard in Napa Valley, California on April 23, 2003. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>For her special day, Acker wore a sheath gown designed by Reva Mivasagar. Her husband went the Italian route with his wedding attire — a black suit by Armani with a white shirt and tie underneath.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Acker completed her bridal looks with rings from her grandmothers, which were also her "something borrowed."</p><p>This means that the couple has been together for 19 years&nbsp;and some change as of August 2022. For their 19th anniversary, Acker made a sweet post on Instagram on April 25, 2022. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Putting up a grayscale picture from their wedding day where they were walking around hand in hand, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">she wrote</a>, "Happy anniversary&nbsp;@jimmycarp! Can’t believe it’s been 19 years! I love you!"</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Amy Acker and James Carpinello’s Children</h2><p>Two years after their marriage, they welcomed their first child — son Jackson James Carpinello was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">born on</a> January 13, 2005. And the following year, they <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">welcomed his sister</a>, daughter Ava Grace Carpinello, on September 1, 2006.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Acker with her husband, James Carpinello, and their children — Jackson James and Ava Grace.</strong> (Photo: Amy Acker/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The teenagers have already started showing their interest in the performance arts.</p><p>James, who is now 17, has already worked alongside his parents — the three starred in Creeper, a short movie that came out in 2022. He is set to graduate from The Buckley School in California in 2023, going by his Instagram bio. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>As for Ava, she found her early calling in something Acker used to do early in her life — dancing. Acker studied dance for 13 years before she made the jump to acting, and Ava seems to have inherited her dancer genes.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>She attends LACHSA (Los Angeles County High School for the Arts) and will graduate from there in 2025.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Acker's bio</a> on her website, she and her family split time between Los Angeles and New York, probably because of Carpinello's Broadway and theater ties. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJmdrnqir8qeqWagpaivorrDZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./discovering-the-hutchinson-family-unraveling-the-connection-between-aidan-and-steve-hutchinson.html><span>←</span><span>Discovering the Hutchinson Family: Unraveling the Connection between Aidan and Steve Hutchinson</span></a>
