During that time, she was discovered by bandleader <strong>David Washington</strong> and gave her a card to audition for the funk band, Chapter 8. In 1975, she joined the band and toured with them until securing a deal with Ariola Records in 1979. However, Chapter 8 was dropped by the Arista records after they were convinced that as the group’s lead singer, Baker did not have “star potential.” Due to this, she returned to Detroit and started to work as a waitress and receptionist until 1982.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Income_As_A_Singer></span>Income As A Singer<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>While working as a waitress and receptionist, Baker was convinced by <strong>Otis Smith</strong> to start a solo career under his Beverly Glen Label.

Among the four singles from the album, Angel became Baker’s first top ten single, which also reached number five on the R&B charts in late 1983.</p><p>Then, in 1985, Anita signed with the Warner Music Group- associated Elektra Records. Under the label, she released her second album, Rapture. Sweet Love,&nbsp;a song from her album, became her first pop hit, which reached number eight on the Billboard Hot 10. By 1988, the album had sold over 5 million copies in the USA and 8 million copies worldwide.</p><p>Since then, Baker has released numerous albums which have won various nominations and significant wealth.

The dispute started when Walter received $12K as 50% of the music royalty payments in 2009.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Lifestyle_And_Assets></span>Lifestyle And Assets<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As stated earlier, Anita Baker’s net worth is currently estimated to be $80 million.
