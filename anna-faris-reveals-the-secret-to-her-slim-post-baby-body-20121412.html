"I think it's from hauling around the little guy," the Tadashi Shoji-clad What's Your Number? actress told <a href=# rel=noopener>E! News</a>. "I'm trying to do it without help, so it's been a lot of lifting."</p><p>Faris' husband, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Chris Pratt</strong></a>, is in awe of the star's rapid <a href=# data-link=1>weight loss</a>. "This is the second date night we've had since she gave birth just three-and-a-half months ago, which is really hard to believe looking at her," the&nbsp; proud 33-year-old said.</p><p>"I have the sweetest husband," Faris, 36, chimed in. "He makes me feel good at any weight. In fact, I kinda think that he likes it when my butt is a little bit bigger!"</p><p>"Yup, I'll take it!" laughed Pratt, who married Faris in 2009. "I like it. Don't work too hard!"</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While Faris is getting back in shape, her hubby is doing just the opposite!&nbsp; Pratt recently packed on the pounds for his role in the <strong>Vince Vaughn</strong> comedy The Delivery Man, formerly known as Starbuck.</p><p>"I gained 60 pounds in about four-and-a-half months. I just did it the old fashioned way: eating and drinking my face off," <a href=# rel=noopener>he said on The Tonight Show With Jay Leno Dec. 10</a>. "I've lost a little bit of it, but it was hard. It was probably just as hard as losing weight. You wouldn't believe it, but it is. It's these same principle: It's all about pain."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGaapp6Weqet0aKqZqqVq7KiuNJmq6GdXaiypL7ErWStp12dsrN50qWgpmWgpMC1ecGambJlkqSxunmRaWhraWRmf3A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amal-clooney-sister-tala-face-mask-profits-donated-to-charity.html><span>←</span><span>Amal Clooney's sister Tala Alamuddin is donating all profits from face mask sales to the Red Cross</span></a>
