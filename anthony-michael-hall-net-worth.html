Renowned for his several teen-oriented films, back in 1984 director/producer <a href=#>John Hughes</a> recognized Anthony’s work in the role of ‘Rusty Griswold’ from the work ‘National Lampoon’s Vacation’, and thereafter Hughes cast him in his directorial debut ‘Sixteen Candles’, in which Anthony played the role of ‘Farmer Ted’. With the support and recognition from such great mentors from the industry there was little that could stop him from reaching the heights.</p><p>So just how rich is Anthony Michael Hall? Sources estimate that Michael’s net worth is calculated to be $10 million, accumulated during a career spanning almost 40 years in the entertainment industry.</p><h3>Anthony Michael Hall Net Worth $10 Million</h3><p>The only child of jazz singer Mercedes, Anthony’s mother being a single parent worked as a featured singer. Eventually Hall and his mother shifted to California and then to New York City where he spent his growing years. He studied at St. Hilda’s & St. Hugh’s school and then in Manhattan’s Profession Children’s school. Despite the fact that Hall never attended college he claims to be an avid reader still in the process of educating himself!</p><p>Anthony kick started his career at the age of seven by acting in TV commercials. He debuted on stage as the young Steve Allen in his life story ‘The Wake’ in 1977. Sailing with the flow, Anthony took up many roles and appeared in ‘St. Joan of the Microphone’, then made his debut on screen in the TV movie ‘The Gold Bug’ in 1980. Anthony came into the real spotlight after the release of the film ‘Six Pack’! Then, still being a 13 year-old Anthony gave such a performance in ‘National Lampoon’s Vacation’ that the film was a box office hit which earned then huge revenue at the US box office of $61 million!</p><p>Later in 1985 Anthony appeared in two of <a href=#>Hughes</a> films, he played ‘Brian Johnson’ form the film ‘The Breakfast Club’ and as ‘Gary Wallace’ in ‘Weird Science’. He was trouped as a member of ‘Saturday Night Life’ at the age of 17 and has thus been declared the youngest member to date to be cast in SNL. He was also an eminent part of big hits like ‘Six Degrees Of Separation’ and ‘Edward Scissorhands’ while being a standard member on the ‘Dead Zone’. All these accomplishments of Anthony played a big part in increasing his net worth!</p><p>Overall, Anthony Michael Hall has been involved in at least one capacity in almost 50 movies, and over 20 TV productions.</p><p>Further, carrying forward his family tradition of singing, Hall was a song writer as well a lead singer in his band ‘Hall of Mirrors’ which he created in 1998. The band soon released an album named ‘Welcome to the Hall of Mirrors’ in an association with Gilby Clarke, a former guitarist from the band ‘Guns N’ Roses’.</p><p>One may wonder why Anthony’s net worth isn’t somewhat higher, considering his successful career. One reason may be previous problems with alcohol, which caused a hiatus of several years for Anthony. However, these are apparently past problems, and although never married he is currently assumed to be dating Fiona Forbes, a Canadian TV personality.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=23.364485981308><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Anthony Michael Hall</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$10 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>April 14, 1968</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>West Roxbury, Boston, Massachusetts, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6 ft 2 in (1.88 m)</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Film Producer, Television producer, Musician, Film director, Singer-songwriter</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>St. Hilda’s & St. Hugh’s school, Manhattan’s Profession Children’s school</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Larry Hall, Mercedes Hall</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Mary Christian</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Nicknames</td><td>Michael Anthony Thomas Charles Hall , Michael Anthony Hall , Hall, Anthony Michael</td></tr><tr readability=0.32558139534884><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/mikehalltexas</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001309</a></td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Awards</td><td>MTV Movie Silver Bucket of Excellence Award, MTV Movie Silver Bucket of Excellence Award</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Albums</td><td>‘Welcome to the Hall of Mirrors’</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Music Groups</td><td>‘Hall of Mirrors’ (1998-), ‘Dead Zone’</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>Movies</td><td>‘The Gold Bug’ (1980), ‘The Breakfast Club’ , ‘Gary Wallace’, ‘Weird Science’, ‘The Wake’ (1977), ‘Rusty Griswold’, ‘National Lampoon’s Vacation’, ‘Sixteen Candles’</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>TV Shows</td><td>The Dead Zone, Saturday Night Live, Psych, Retrosexual</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks readability=1.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr readability=3><td>1</td><td>During the early years of his career he often played dweebish, unpopular teenagers</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=22.426147704591><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>1</td><td>[2003] I don't really do the Hollywood party thing.

I can't hide from that. I always embrace the work I've done before. I wouldn't be where I am now if it wasn't for those movies.
