"I went through a phase of making Tim Burton-esque cakes," she added. "<strong>It was my backlash to cupcakes</strong> because they were so pretty, but didn't taste very good. I like cakes that are different, but delicious."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c42a872c5d3d-cakes-z.jpg><p id=e2pUAPXKk3ff data-wc=11><strong>HELLO!

"I ask people what their favourite flavours are and work from that," she said. "When people come to me without ideas, I tell them to look at my Pinterest to see what they like/don't like. Then the cake starts coming together".</p><p id=e3fKKRjdvsUw data-wc=25>"My favourite flavour at the moment is a beetroot, sweet potato and parsnip cake," she added.
