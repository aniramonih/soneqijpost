It now has an asking price of $2.45m.</p><p>The 1.12ha pad boasts period features such as soaring timber ceilings, arched windows and polished hardwood floors. It still exists as it did when it was built in around 1870, with only minor upkeep changes since.</p><p><b>RELATED: <a class=body-link href=# title=www.realestate.com.au>Unique rural retreat with its own church, just 40 minutes from the city</a></b></p><p><b><a class=body-link href=# title=www.realestate.com.au>Converted 1860s courthouse up for sale in Taradale</a></b></p><p><b><a class=body-link href=# title=www.realestate.com.au>Historic Bellarine Peninsula church has makings of a heavenly home</a></b></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/content.api.news/v3/images/bin/d7cc4b92b9f371105f941413e021cc8c width=1280 height=720 alt="The listings wowing buyers" fetchpriority=high style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>An entrance inside the main church leads to it’s two-storey extension, where five bedrooms, a galley kitchen, and three bathrooms lie. Leadlight windows and a tiled, north facing conservatory also add to the charm of the residence.</p><p>Over the course of the two decades living there, the Skepper family have tended to the abode, growing it’s now established, sprawling garden to include fruit trees and an on-site mineral spring bore. A huge dam also recycles grey water back into the garden.</p><p>The family have used the church not only for residence, but also as an artistic space, drawing inspiration from the peaceful surroundings.</p><p>“(The place) has created this complete ecosystem which has been an incredible inspiration for my art,” said Mr Skepper.</p><p>“I just love the serenity and the calm of being away from the city. The privacy was also something that I really valued.</p><p>“It’s emotional for us to let go of the property.”</p><p>Jellis Craig Castlemaine agent Carole Lenander said there has been international interest in the church, including inquiries from buyers in New York.</p><p>“I think it will appeal to someone similar (to the Skepper family) – someone artistic or who wants a private country getaway,” she said.</p><p>The rich history of the church lives on through its red bricks, which were used as ship ballast when being transported to Taradale from England in 1870. The Penny a Week school also operated within the building for 30 years up until 1910.</p><p>Ms Lenander said the Taradale corridor – once a major stopover for gold miners travelling between Bendigo and Melbourne – is “still as popular as it ever has been.”</p><p>Also within the goldfields region, another historic church has hit the market in Kingston with a $3.89m – $4.28m price guide.</p><p>The <a class=body-link href=# title=www.realestate.com.au>1 Church Pde</a> bluestone residence – known as Kingston Abbey Estate – was built circa 1860, with its original leadlight doors still intact. It has since been renovated, now hosting eight bedrooms and four bathrooms.</p><p>It’s positioned on a sprawling 1.21ha block, which has three guesthouses in addition to the main church, each fit with a spa, wood fire, and expansive views of the Pyrenees Ranges.</p><p>Similar to the Taradale listing, it also features an edible garden – including pinot noir vines, and olive, apple, quince, orange and lemon trees.</p><p>Don Pollock and his wife Faye bought the property back in 2009 for $900,000, according to CoreLogic. They’ve lived at the residence since.</p><p>“The church was originally called the Holy Trinity Church of England, and the foundations were done pretty much in the peak of the gold rush,” said Mr Pollock.</p><p>He said that it operated as a church right up until it was deconsecrated in 1966. It was then sold to the Ballarat rowing club, and sold again in 1978. The new owner occupied the residence for 12 years, during which time he built the guesthouses, according to Mr Pollock.</p><p>“(The property) has really rich volcanic soil. It’s been astounding – we were left with a lot of history from previous people which was pretty special,” Mr Pollock said.</p><p>“It’s so beautiful and serene, it’s (been) a lovely country lifestyle.”</p><p>Mr Pollock said local councils have also been working to gain UNESCO World Heritage listing for the Central Victorian Goldfields region.</p><p><b>Sign up to the Herald Sun Weekly Real Estate Update.
