Blake face has changed so much from 2005 to 2023.</p><p>Born in Los Angeles, California, the 35-year-old film star celebrates her birthday on 25th August. She debuted in the movie at the age of 11.</p><p>Known for her natural aesthetics, the Green Lantern star has had her share of surgeries throughout the years. From upper eyelids to Botox, the leading lady has undergone a few surgeries to enhance her beauty.</p><p>The delicate transfiguration of several facial parts while still maintaining the natural form helped the personality attract few attention and appear more beautiful.</p><p>As of 2023, she is married to actor Ryan Reynolds, and the couple is the parents of four children.</p><h2 id=face-throughout-the-years>Face Throughout The Years</h2><p>Blake Lively before and after nose job pictures presents the Hollywood actress with a refined look. The actress we saw in 2005 had different facial features.</p><p>Over the years, Ryan's spouse's nose has undergone a distinct transformation. One can look at the pictures of the actor from her early days and can clearly see the difference.</p><p>The talk about <a href=# rel=noopener>rhinoplasty</a>, a treatment that is done to alter the shape and size of the nose, has always been brought into the limelight. The 35-year-old has neither accepted nor denied the claims.</p><p>But one thing is for sure, the mother of four displays a major transformation in her physiognomy.</p><h3>In 2005</h3><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/posts/aa69c951-2b5e-4b17-b909-33ad18867106/blake-lively-2005.webp></p><p>Blake Lively in 2005 starred in The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. She was 18 years old then.</p><p>The performer was previously seen in 1998's Sandman, directed by her father, Ernie Lively. It was a small role as Trixie, but nevertheless, it marked her acting debut.</p><p>Looking at entertainers' pictures from that year, we notice a flatter and broader breathing organ.</p><p>She had a wide nasal bridge and a broad tip. She also had a droopy nasal tip. It means that her tips were pointing downwards.</p><p>Dr. Gary Motykie, in his <a href=# rel=noopener>YouTube </a>video, described the artist's nose as spherical shaped with a plunging nasal tip.</p><p>The celebrity's natural look is aesthetic, and she appears generously beautiful in her teenage years. At that period, she had only completed high school. The shooting for her breakthrough film occurred during her junior and senior high school years.</p><h3>In 2023</h3><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/posts/aa69c951-2b5e-4b17-b909-33ad18867106/blake-lively-in-2023.webp></p><p>Blake Lively in 2023 is a mother of four children. She welcomed baby no. 4 in February 2023.</p><p>Around 2007, speculations about her undergoing a rhinoplasty circulated. It was the phase when she was cast in the teen drama Gossip Girl.</p><p>The change was apparent for anyone to notice. Some alteration was seen in her facial look. She did not look exactly the same person from a couple of years earlier.</p><p>Looking at the recent picture of the movie star, one can point out the modification in her facial dimension, particularly her respiratory area.</p><p>Her nose now appears a bit slimmer and small. The nasal bridge is substantially narrowed.</p><p>It can be seen that the nasal tips of the nose have also diminished. Likewise, her nasal tip is rotated up and no longer pointing downward. A more defined nasal tip has enhanced the natural beauty of the star.</p><p>Her rhinoplasty has been done conservatively, making the process look natural. She tweaked it again around 2010 to get a more refined look.</p><p>Many might wonder whether the celebrity actually underwent an incision or not. Either way, the actress looks fabulous in the present time and date. Her natural beauty still amazes her fans; many desire a nose like hers.</p><h2 id=cosmetic-surgery>Cosmetic Surgery</h2><p>Blake Lively plastic surgery includes rhinoplasty, blepharoplasty, breast augmentation, and lip fillers. The most noticeable change in the actress is her nose.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/posts/aa69c951-2b5e-4b17-b909-33ad18867106/blake-lively.webp></p><p>Blake trimmed her nose through rhinoplasty to make it refined and detailed, adding more value to her face.</p><p>The procedure was noticed in 2007. The alteration of the nasal bridge and nasal tips made the movie star more appealing. Because the process was done conservatively and in a very fine manner, the change appeared natural.</p><h4>Blake has her upper eyelid fixed</h4><p>Another facial augmentation that The Shallows star underwent was blepharoplasty. The heavier upper eyelid is gone.</p><p>In her younger days, the artist had a hefty upper eyelid. It made her look a bit tired in some instances.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/posts/aa69c951-2b5e-4b17-b909-33ad18867106/blake-lively-plastic-surgery.webp></p><p>But she jumped into the ship to fix her upper eyelid once she got her first transformation. The heaviness in her eyes is gone.</p><p>The process was done smoothly, so it did not appear too dramatic. The eyes have more openings.</p><p>The upper eyelid looks lifted, and her eyes are highlighted more now. The weightiness is eradicated, and she appears more rested.</p><h4>She got a breast augmentation, lip fillers, and Botox surgery</h4><p>The Burbank High School alumnus also got a breast augmentation. She currently has fuller breasts compared to her prior pictures from the mid-2000s.</p><p>Likewise, lip filler is another cosmetic aciurgy done by the actress. In her younger days, she used to have thin lips.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/posts/aa69c951-2b5e-4b17-b909-33ad18867106/blake-lively-lip-fillers.webp></p><p>Her gums and beautifully aligned teeth would be visible whenever she smiled. But, looking at her pictures from 2007 afterward, one can notice the change. The lips are a bit fuller.</p><p>When she grins, the gums are no longer visible.</p><p>Similarly, the Californian has undergone Botox surgery as well. In all her pictures from recent times, the actress appears wrinkleless.</p><p>The actresses around her age group have wrinkles around the eyes and forehead. But, this is different with Betty Buzz's owner.</p><p>The process of reconstruction, and restoration of the face and other body parts is a common topic in show business. Some names who have gone under the knife are:</p><ul><li><a href=# rel=noopener>Lory Hill</a></li><li><a href=# rel=noopener>Jonathan Cheban</a></li><li><a href=# rel=noopener>Tisha Campbell</a></li><li><a href=# rel=noopener>Sarah Brightman</a></li><li><a href=# rel=noopener>Martin Hayter Short</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirmKTEo7XZnKarppWne6S7zGiZpZmbmnqttdWeo7JlkpqzsL7EZqWoq5Vit7Cu</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rosie-mcclelland.html><span>←</span><span>Biography, Age, Height, Parents, Ethnicity, Net Worth, Boyfriend &amp;amp; More</span></a>
