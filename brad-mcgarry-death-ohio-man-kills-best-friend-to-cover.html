Despite the hurdles and bullying he encountered, Brad cultivated a supportive network of friends who cherished his authenticity. He initially pursued a career as a hairdresser but later transitioned to working as a coal miner, seeking financial stability.</p><p>Tragedy struck on May 7, 2017, when David Kinney, not only Brad’s best friend but also a fellow miner, accompanied by his wife Cheri and their daughter, discovered Brad’s lifeless body in his home. Brad had suffered two gunshot wounds to the head, and his house appeared to have been ransacked. The police, however, swiftly dismissed the theory of a burglary, suspecting an attempt to mislead their investigation due to the staged disorder and lack of forced entry.</p><p>It was revealed that Brad recently ended his relationship with an individual named Scotty, corroborated by Brad’s friend Wendy Newbaur. When the police questioned Scotty, he was found to be incarcerated in a West Virginia jail at the time of the murder.</p><p>Initially, co-workers were considered as potential suspects, driven by suspicions related to Brad’s sexuality and lifestyle. However, the investigation soon disproved this theory, as it became evident that Brad was well-liked by his colleagues, lacking any apparent motive to harm him.</p><p>During the inquiry, Brad’s cousin, Schuyler Strawser, shared crucial information. He revealed Brad’s long-term relationship with a man named DJ, who was married to another woman. Brad had been urging DJ to be honest with his spouse about their relationship. DJ had been in Brad’s company on the day of the murder until approximately 1:30 p.m., a fact that surprised the police as it was none other than David Kinney himself.</p><p>Subsequently, David Kinney, aged 31, was brought in for questioning. While he initially confessed to a secret relationship with Brad, he vehemently denied any involvement in his murder. However, phone records contradicted his alibi, revealing his presence at Brad’s house during the murder. Confronted with this evidence, David provided a series of conflicting narratives.</p><p>First, he claimed the presence of an unidentified man at the murder scene who threatened him into silence. When this account seemed implausible, he alleged self-defense, stating that Brad had produced a gun when David tried to end their romantic relationship. However, the gunshot wound to the back of Brad’s head did not align with this self-defense narrative.</p><h5>read more:<a href=#>Mark Steuer Dies in Car Accident, La Porte Indiana Resident</a></h5><p>On May 9, 2017, David was arrested and charged with Brad’s murder. His continued assertions of self-defense failed to convince the police. David had a heartfelt conversation with his wife Cheri, who showed genuine shock and had no involvement in the crime.</p><p>The death of Brad McGarry remains shrouded in mystery as investigators seek to unravel the truth behind the tragic incident.</p><p>Thanks for reading from <a href=# rel=noopener>Ghsplash</a> a news publishing website from Ghana.
