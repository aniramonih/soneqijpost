More than a month after his passing, people continue to mourn his loss even now. Braun Strowman was very close to Wyatt and revealed a touching story about Wyatt recently as well.</p><p>Time heals all wounds but it still hasn’t been long since Bray Wyatt passed away, which is why his family is having a difficult time passing each day. Even then, Wyatt’s family continues to get a ton of support from those who were close to Bray Wyatt and that includes Braun Strowman.</p><p>Strowman made his debut on the main roster as part of the Wyatt Family. The Monster among Men joined the cult faction and immediately made an impact on the main roster. That said, he was very green during his initial year in WWE and didn’t necessarily make great money either.</p><p>While speaking on <a href=#>The Ranveer Show</a>, Braun Strowman talked about how wonderful of a human being Bray Wyatt was. Strowman revealed how Bray Wyatt paid for his hotel rooms and food for a month while he was just finding his feet on the main roster.</p><p>“When I got called up to the main roster, I didn’t have enough money to pay for my hotel rooms while we went on the road. So for the first month, Bray paid for everything for me. He bought me food, he paid for my hotel rooms, all that stuff, and I drove him around everywhere, and I learned from him.”</p><p>Braun Strowman will likely be absent from WWE television for a year after surgery. He is also using&nbsp;<a href=#>steam cell therapy to rebuild himself</a>. He will continue to&nbsp;love Bray Wyatt no matter what and that is never changing.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What do you think of what Braun Strowman had to say?
