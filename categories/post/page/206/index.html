Dack had just come off of 'Paper Dolls', which wasn't the most masculine show. It's interesting to binge watch 'Dallas' and see the quickly changing hairstyles the characters have. Dack's hair in in this 2nd scene is blown out to within an inch of its life, he's sashaying around in tighter than tight jeans, and wearing a tan leather jacket.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Dad or Alive is Not an Actual Band, But the Real Weezer Are in Family Switch</h2><time>Aug 8, 2024</time>
