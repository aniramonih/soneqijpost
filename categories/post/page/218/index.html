I‚Äôve always thought that Mario Lopez was probably pretty douchey in real life. His brief marriage to Ali Landry was annulled after she allegedly (or not so much) learned that he was a massive cheater, and his relationship with his baby-mama, Courtney Mazza, seems‚Ä¶ odd. Courtney doesn‚Äôt have a lot going on, and my take on it is that Mario is doing a ‚ÄúMy Fair Lady‚Äù on Courtney. Like, he‚Äôs remaking her into someone he feels he can take out in public, reportedly making her get lipo and a boob job, and allegedly encouraging her to look and dress a certain way.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Meet Rayshad Lewis, Diaymon Desiree Lewis, Rashaan Lewis, Ralin Lewis and Kaitlin Lewis</h2><time>Aug 7, 2024</time>
