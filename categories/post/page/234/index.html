<a href=../../../../how-much-money-do-you-give-for-a-confirmation-gift-html.html></a>
Answer
Depending on how close the gift-giver is to the confirmed individual, the amount of money donated to commemorate a person’s religious confirmation varies. While twenty-five dollars is a reasonable sum for friends to contribute, family members may contribute $100 or more, as well as another present with religious meaning.
