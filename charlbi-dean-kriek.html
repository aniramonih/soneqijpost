According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">People</a>, NYC Medical Examiner revealed that the model/actress met with an accident at the age of 18 and had suffered injuries on her torso. Doctors had to remove her spleen, and the absence of the spleen weakened her immunity over time.</p><p>As per the said sources, a bacteria named <strong>Capnocytophaga</strong> entered Kriek’s body and caused sepsis. Dean’s body could not fight back, which took her life.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Charlbi Dean Kriek getting proposed by her boyfriend Luke Volker" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Charlbi-Dean-Kriek-getting-proposed-by-her-boyfriend-Luke-Volker.jpg alt="Charlbi Dean Kriek getting proposed by her boyfriend Luke Volker" width=400 height=320 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><strong>Charlbi Dean Kriek’s Fiancé</strong></h2><p>In 2018 Dean met a model named Luke Volker and fell in love with him.

As expected, Kriek said “Yes” and shared the news with her fans on Instagram (charlbi143) by sharing a series of photographs.</p><p>Other than the Kriek family, Volker is the one who got the most after the demise of Charlbi. He was planning to marry her and wanted to spend his entire life with her.

The African model suffered multiple injuries, including broken ribs and a broken wrist. For two years, she stayed away from any modeling project, but in 2010, she returned as an actress, debuting with a movie called “Spud.”</p><p>She found it pleasant to work as an actress and started looking for more opportunities. But it did not take her much time to find her second acting job; one after another, she kept doing movies and short movies. From 2011 to 2014, the South African actress worked on various projects, including “Illusive Fields,” “Death Race 3: Inferno,” and “Spud 2: The Madness Continues.”</p><p><img decoding=async title="Charlbi Dean Kriek in Triangle of Sadness" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Charlbi-Dean-Kriek-in-Triangle-of-Sadness.jpg alt="Charlbi Dean Kriek in Triangle of Sadness" width=450 height=257 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Besides big-screen, Charlbi also worked on a couple of TV shows, one of which was Salim Akil’s sci-fi action drama “Black Lightning,” which aired in 2018.
