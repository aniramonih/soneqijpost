Like, my mom can’t just come downstairs and help me. She’s gonna have to drive to my house?’ That’s weird. I don’t even wanna move out when I turn 18.”</p><p id=par-5_44>Her father Marc also revealed to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gotham</a> that she and his wife, Heidi, were not overbearing about <a href=#>D’Amelio getting chores done</a>. He said, “Back in the day, I might’ve nagged about the rooms and things like that. I’m a little bit more lenient now.”</p><p id=par-6_27>At the time, she was living with her parents in a mansion in Los Angeles. Fans saw their family life on the Hulu series <a href=#>The D’Amelio Show</a>.</p><h2>Charli D’Amelio recently moved out of her parents’ house</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_51>Although D’Amelio felt like she wasn’t ready for independence, she recently took the step to move out anyway. The TikTok star told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a> at TIME’s Women of the Year Gala on March 8 that she had moved out on her own, but she and her parents still see each other frequently.</p><p id=par-8_27>“I literally just moved out like three days ago, and I’ve seen them every single day,” D’Amelio said. “I don’t know what to do without my parents.”</p><p id=par-9_15>She added, “I literally moved, like, two minutes away and I’m like, ‘I miss you.’”</p><h2>Dixie D’Amelio has already been living on her own</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-10_30><a href=#>D’Amelio’s older sister, Dixie</a>, is also a social media star. Being three years older, Dixie has already moved out and has been living on her own for a while now.</p><p id=par-11_50>In 2020, Dixie talked about the experience on the sisters’ podcast, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">2 Chix</a>, “Living alone is really fun, but at the same time, it’s scary because it gets so quiet. I have no one to talk to, but also I like that. I don’t know how I feel about it.”</p><p id=par-12_49>She added, “I think also, once I get all my stuff together … I’m just very anxious being home ’cause my place is a mess, because I don’t have anywhere to put anything, but once I get that figured out, it’s going to be a lot easier I think.”</p><p id=par-13_32>In October 2021—a year after she moved out—Dixie gave fans a tour of her apartment on her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube channel</a>. However, Dixie also mentioned that she would soon move to a new place.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSwqa3RpaBmnJGisq21zmapnq6Vlrm0ecyorZ6cXaTCtXnPmqmepqSoeqm71KycZquknrmtedKenKxlpJ2yrnnEr5yrsV2otq%2Bzy55knZmpY7W1ucto</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./celebrity-parents-praising-their-kids-nannies-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Celebrity Parents Praising Their Kids Nannies: Photos</span></a>
