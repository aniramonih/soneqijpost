Now, Chelsea Green is able to explain this situation.</p><p>Despite some confusion among fans,<a href=#> it has been clarified that Matt Cardona was indeed wearing replica </a>of the title belt and not the real one during his appearance in Japan. Chelsea, the actual title holder, posted a video to clear up the misunderstanding and confirmed that she still possesses the legitimate championship belt.</p><p>During this week’s episode of Raw, Matt Cardona was present backstage with Chelsea and Sonya, where the latter two captured the titles. That was a huge moment for them.</p><p>WWE management is <a href=#>reportedly optimistic about Chelsea and Sonya’s reign </a>with the titles and believes they can bring stability to the women’s tag division. It is apparent that they are gaining a lot of steam. Samantha Irvin also has a fantastic way of saying Green’s name.</p><p>Chelsea Green logged onto Twitter and she had something to say about her husband wearing a WWE Women’s Tag Team Championship on him in DDT Pro. It turns out that the title was a replica.</p><p>Chelsea Green captioned her video by saying: “Twitter continues to lose brain cells.” She obviously wasn’t happy about the reaction to Matt Cardona’s little nod to her championship win.</p><p>We will have to see if anything comes of this. If it was a replica, then Chelsea Green did nothing wrong. She’s just married to Matt Cardona, and that has its own share of faults attached to it.</p><p>What’s your take on Matt Cardona’s recent stunt from Matt Cardona?
