Chris Robinson is best known for being the lead singer of the band The Black Crowes and for being formerly married to actress <a href=#>Kate Hudson</a>. The Black Crowes have sold over 30 million albums worldwide to date. He has remained the leader singer and one of the only continuous members of the group since its inception. Robinson has also enjoyed a successful solo carer.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Robinson was born on December 20, 1966 in Marietta, a suburb of Atlanta, Georgia. He is the son of Nancy Jane and Stanley Robinson. His father had had a minor record in 1959 called "Boom-A-Dip-Dip." He grew up with his brother Rich. Chris and Rich were both interested in music from a young age. They originally formed a band called Mr. Crowe's Garden in the early 1980s that was heavily inspired by bands like The Faces and The Rolling Stones. They played a variety of shows at clubs around the Atlanta area. While pursuing music, Robinson also focused on his education. He attended Wofford College in Spartanburg, South Carolina.</p><h2 id=black-crowes><strong>The Black Crowes</strong></h2><p>In 1989, Robinson and his brother decided to change the name of Mr. Crowe's Garden to The Black Crowes. They signed with <a href=# title="Rick Rubin Net Worth">Rick Rubin</a> to his Def American label and released their debut album "Shake Your Money Maker." The album was quite successful and helped the band land a spot touring with ZZ Top. However, they only ended up playing one show on the tour as Robinson began talking to the audience about his opposition to corporate sponsorship, which led ZZ Top to fire The Black Crowes from the tour. "Rolling Stone" magazine voted The Black Crowes the Best New American Band in 1990.</p><p>Over the next decade or so, The Black Crowes steadily rose in fame and popularity, especially after releasing their popular second album, "The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion." The band experienced many changes in its lineup over the years, with Robinson and his brother being the only continuous members of the band throughout its existence. They have released a total of eight studio albums, with the first two being the most commercially successful. However, they did go on hiatus from 2002 to 2005 and then toured for a few years before releasing the album "Warpaint" in 2008. "Warpaint" did comparatively well on the charts, making it to the fifth spot. In 2010, they released a greatest hits album called "Croweology" and then started a 20th anniversary tour, after which they took a second hiatus. They broke up and got back together several times throughout the 2010s, ultimately again reuniting in 2020 to honor the 30 year anniversary of the release of their first album, "Shake Your Money Maker." Over the course of their time together, The Black Crowes have sold over 30 million records.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-254710 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/GettyImages-143817420.jpg alt width=594 height=396 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-254710 class=wp-caption-text>Getty Images</p><h2 id=solo-other-work><strong>Solo and Other Work</strong></h2><p>Outside of his career with The Black Crowes, Robinson has also pursued a solo career as well as other collaborative projects in music. He released his first solo recording, "The Red Road," in 2002, which appeared on the soundtrack for the film "The Banger Sisters." He released a full-length debut solo album called "New Earth Mud" a few months later which received generally positive critical reviews. He subsequently formed a band which he called New Earth Mud and toured around the United States performing lengthy jam-oriented shows. In June of 2004, he released his second album, "This Magnificent Distance," which was a bigger commercial success than its predecessor and showcased a more full band sound. When touring with the new album, Robinson changed the original line up for New Earth Mud without explanation and began touring instead with new musicians.</p><p>Another music endeavor that Robinson has created is the Chris Robinson Brotherhood, which launched a two-month tour in California in 2011. The group released their first album, "Big Moon Ritual," in June of 2012 and released a companion album, "The Magic Door," in September of 2012. Robinson also formed a band in 2018 called As the Crow Flies, which performs songs from The Black Crowes catalogue. The band includes other former members of The Black Crowes. Robinson has stated that the purpose of the project is not to outdo the original band but rather just to have an outlet to perform the music.</p><p>In addition to making music, Robinson also has worked as a music producer for other artists' albums, which he began doing more consistently in the late 2000s. He has worked with artists like Gary Louris, Mark Olson, Truth & Savage Co., and The Kinsey Report, among others.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>In 1996, Robinson married Lala Sloatman, the niece of musician <a href=# title="Frank Zappa Net Worth">Frank Zappa</a>. They remained married for two years before divorcing in 1998. In December of 2000, Robinson married actress Kate Hudson. The two had met at a live performance of "The Kids in the Hall" in 2000. They had a son together in January of 2004. After being married for six years, Hudson announced they would be separating. She filed for divorce in November of 2006 and it was officially granted in October of 2007. The parents were granted joint custody over their son. In 2009, Robinson married Allison Bridges. The couple had a daughter together in December of 2009. Robinson and Bridges divorced in October of 2018. He subsequently began dating Camille Johnson. The two married in January of 2020.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70aiapGWjqa6zv46cn6uho2K%2FsK7Ip6qopl2jsrV51qipraBf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chris-gardner-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Chris Gardner Net Worth</span></a>
