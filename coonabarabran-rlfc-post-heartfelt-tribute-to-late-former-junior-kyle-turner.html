He was such a tough, uncompromising player on the field, yet a lovely, generous man off the field.</p><p>“We offer our full support to his family and friends at this very difficult time, and he will always be remembered at our Club as a man that delivered a premiership to the Rabbitohs, but also a man that connected deeply with his communities.</p><p>“We will hold him close to our hearts for the rest of this season and in the years to come. Vale Kyle Turner.”</p><p>Tributes are flowing for the former NRL star online, with many fans expressing their shock over the tragic news.</p><p>“Rest in peace Kyle Turner. So sad to hear he has passed away,” one woman wrote on Twitter.</p><p>“He is a great player and a 2014 premiership winner. I met him at Eastgardens in 2016, thoughts and prayers are with him and his family.”</p><p>Other NRL fans agree Turner was “taken too soon”.</p><p>One person wrote online: “Always a 2014 Rabbitoh premiership player, taken away too soon. Only the good die young.”</p><p>Another person said the news was “terrible”.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>“(He) was always one of the nicest and most welcoming guys at Souths, and someone you were genuinely happy to see win a premiership in 2014,” the social media user wrote.</p><p>“Thinking of all his family and friends, along with everyone at Souths and Coonabarabran.”</p><p><i>- with NCA NewsWire</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ70qmmq6xfo7%2Bte8KopqeZkpa%2Foq7RmqVmqpybsG68zqyrZqCVlr%2B1ssSlq2asop6vtsDEZquoZZyWwaZ5xaippp2iYre2usioqWajqaGybsDUq6Weql%2Bjsri%2FjKyrqKqpZLJzscNvmHBtaWuwdLHDmmhqaZSXs6WxkGlsbJyVaq55</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rodner-figueroa-net-worth-income-salary-html.html><span>←</span><span>Rodner Figueroa Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
