Daniel stars in as gay vicar Billy, who has been involved in screen romance with Todd Grimshaw (Bruno Langley) and Sean Tulley (Anthony Cotton). A source told the <strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Sun</a></strong>: "Daniel was instantly attracted to Rob when he joined the cast. They got on really well and quickly developed feeling for each other. The cast love having them together at social occasions and there is definitely real chemistry there.

But that was just my own fears because I do believe they will."&nbsp;He added: "I was very fortunate, I had a very non-plussed family and it's become the subject of warm, friendly general humour over the years."</p><p id=e_7a69VVC7NH data-wc=6><a class=hm-link href=#>All the latest Coronation Street news...</a></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
