"If you don't have an eye primer on hand, I like to take any excess foundation from my brush and sweep over the lid to act as a primer for eyeshadow and eyeliner," says Duyos.</li><li>Use a dark eyeshadow or eye pencil and apply it to the crease. "Starting with a darker shade will help to define the end result of the cut crease," explains Greenberg.</li><li>Blend it out. "Using the tip of a small flat brush, blend the line towards the inner and outer corner of the eye as well as slightly blend upwards," suggests Duyos.</li><li>Add a transition shade above your newly defined cut crease, then Duyos says to blend it up toward the brow.</li><li>Apply full-coverage <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>concealer</a> to your lid. Greenberg says this will cut and cover your entire eyelid stopping right before the crease and giving you a precise and sharp eyeshadow look.</li><li>For your last step, Greenberg says to pack on a lighter eyeshadow shade directly where you placed the concealer to lock it in and prevent any creasing.</li><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: The Unexpected Eye Makeup Color That's About to Be Everywhere</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-can-you-create-a-cut-crease-if-you-have-monolid-or-hooded-eyes></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Can You Create a Cut Crease if You Have Monolid or Hooded Eyes?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Makeup is like painting in that you can create any look you want with the right technique.
