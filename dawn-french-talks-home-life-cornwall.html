"My problem with being in busy places... I find that I get quite upset by constantly seeing difficult things," she said. "So I've been a bit cowardly in a way because I find it... when I go to London and I see, I look at people's faces and I think 'Oh, she's cold. Oh that person hasn't got anywhere to go tonight. Oh God, they're dealing with something, oh God, he looks like he's off his face, oh dear'. And my insides are just upset all the time."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4aab0caddb6b-dawn-french-house-cornwall-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eS-q8Paf5_AK data-wc=10><strong>Dawn French lives in this Grade II-listed mansion in Cornwall</strong></p><p id=ehTK_uD05wde data-wc=81>Dawn said she now felt she isn't suited for busy city life. "I think I'm not meant for a city... that isn't the real me. The real me is quiet." The 60-year-old moved to Cornwall with her former husband Sir Lenny Henry and their daughter Billie in 2006, and stayed there following their divorce in 2010. However, she admitted she ended up arranging a tour with her comedy partner Jennifer Saunders especially to foot the bill for renovations at their property.</p><p id=ec5Q0NKdhOoB data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Inside Dawn French's Cornwall home</a></strong></p><p id=ebmrWuz3kK8X data-wc=81>"It was in a bit of a state and I thought 'Oh, I'm going to need a bit of dosh to do this up', she said. 'I called Jennifer and I said, 'Look I've seen this place and I know I want to live there but we've got to go on tour, how about it?' And she said something like 'Oh yes, I'm doing my conservatory, OK yes.' And that was seriously how we made the decision to go on tour."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c431a097f724-dawn-french-glamour-awards-2017-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eZPtVvUL_CeX data-wc=8><strong>Dawn French said she found city life overwhelming</strong></p><p id=eImUfA4Q07D1 data-wc=48>Dawn now credits the Grade II-listed mansion for keeping her "calm", telling Fearne: "There is, without a doubt, beauty here.
