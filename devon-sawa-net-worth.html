Born on 7 September 1978, Devon is of Polish ancestry. A prominent figure in Hollywood, Sawa is noted for his small but memorable roles in movies, music videos and TV series as well.</p><p>A pop culture icon of the late 1990s, and a teenage sensation of the time, one might wonder how rich is Devon? As estimated by sources, Devon Sawa counts his net worth at an amount of $2 million as of late 2016. Devon’s work on memorable characters in movies and TV series is the major source of his income. His work in movies such as “Final Destination”, “Idle Hands”, “Wild America” and “Casper” among many others has provided him with much needed public recognition as well as wealth.</p><h3>Devon Sawa Net Worth $2 million</h3><p>Raised in Vancouver with his two siblings, Devon developed an interest in acting at a very young age; his first acting role was in a play in kindergarten. Realizing his interest in acting, Devon started to perform in local plays in his hometown as well as in school events. It was from those stage plays that he was able to attract the attention of casting agents and was given an opportunity to appear in an advertising commercial, making his first TV appearance in 1992 in an advertisement for Nerf toys. This gave him immense publicity which successfully landed him roles in movies; he appeared in the children’s movie “Little Giant” as a misfit quarterback, but “Casper” was the big break for Devon, in which he portrayed human Casper and starred in the movie with actors <a href=#>Christina Ricci</a> and <a href=#>Bill Pullman</a>. At this point of his career, Devon was already adding thousands of dollars to his net worth.</p><p>Devon got his chance in a mainstream movie with the 1999 teen horror movie “Idle Hands” in which he shared the screen with actress <a href=#>Jessica Alba</a>. The movie inspired by the “Scream” series was expected to become a great hit in Hollywood, but the Columbine high school tragedy occurred shortly after the release of movie, and as the country was in shock due to violence occurred, the movie didn’t succeed commercially. In 2000, “Final Destination” – an American horror franchise – contributed to Devon’s stardom as he won a Saturn award for his role as Alex Browning in the movie. Later, his portrayal of Stanley in the <a href=#>Eminem</a> hit song “Stan” video also helped his popularity. He was a regular in “Nikita”, a TV series from 2010 until 2013, and he recently appeared in the 2016 movies “Punk’s Dead” as Sean and “Life On The Line” as Duncan in which co-starred with actors Adam Pascal, Ben Schnetzer, <a href=#>John Travolta</a>, <a href=#>Kate Bosworth</a> among others. All of these and many more of Sawa’s projects have been responsible for his present net worth.</p><p>As for his personal life, Devon has been married to Dawni Sahanovitch since 2010, and the couple share a son and a daughter. For now, Devon Sava enjoys his life as a prominent Hollywood actor while his present net worth of $2 million caters to his and his family’s daily lives.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=14.793503480278><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Devon Sawa</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$2 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>511,200 USD</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>September 7, 1978</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Vancouver, Canada</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.83 m</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>86&nbsp;kg</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Voice Actor</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Vancouver Film School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>Canadian</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Dawni Sahanovitch (m. 2010)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td>Scarlett Heleena Sawa, Hudson Sawa</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Joyce Sawa, Edward Sawa</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Siblings</td><td>Stephanie Sawa, Brandon Sawa</td></tr><tr readability=0.37837837837838><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/DevonESawa</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001701/</a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Awards</td><td>Saturn Award - Best Performance by a Younger Actor (2001)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Nominations</td><td>Blockbuster Entertainment Awards, Teen Choice Awards, Young Artist Awards</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Movies</td><td>“Final Destination” (2000), “Idle Hands” (1999), “Wild America”, “Casper” (1995), “Now and Then” (1995), “Little Giants” (1994)</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>TV Shows</td><td>“Nikita” (2010-2013), “The Odyssey” (1992-1994), “Action Man” (1995-1996), “Somewhere Between” (since 2017)</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=50><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=7><td>1</td><td>For instance, when I go to the premiere on Tuesday I probably won't watch the film at all - I'll be watching the audience just to see their reaction to different moments, what I'm doing right and what I'm doing wrong, stuff like that.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>2</td><td>You know, I've never shot a gun in a movie.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>3</td><td>I look for things that are going to challenge me as an actor.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>4</td><td>I guess I'm growing up in the film world.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>5</td><td>I was a hyper kid in school and the teacher suggested to my mom she needed to do something with me.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>6</td><td>I've never liked the press part of it (no offense), but it comes with the job.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>7</td><td>Final Destination was the closest thing I've done to a teen movie but it certainly had an edge to it.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>8</td><td>The next movie I do is not going to be in school.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>9</td><td>When the movie's on, I usually watch more of the audience.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>10</td><td>For every 10 good things, there's always some jerk that wants to say something bad.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>11</td><td>I've always been interesting in the lighting aspect and always listened to what they were saying.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>12</td><td>I can't do talk shows, I don't do them, just because I get really nervous and fidgeting and shaky.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>13</td><td>I don't think I want to play a teenager anymore.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>14</td><td>I spent most of my high school years on movie sets and I'd have like one teacher, which was really bad.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>15</td><td>I started off in a small theatre performance company and worked my way into commercials.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>16</td><td>Id like to do an action film or a dark sort of independent piece.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>17</td><td>I'm trying to go through the whole process of high school to college to work.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>18</td><td>I took six months off, finished high school, and hung out with friends.</td></tr><tr readability=14><td>19</td><td>(2012, on landing the "Stan" Eminem video because of Dr. Dre) I had a friend who was a mutual friend. That friend called me up saying, "Hey, Dre's a big fan of Final Destination. Would you come in and meet Eminem?" And I said, "In a heartbeat." I went into the studio and I met him and he approved it. And the next week we were shooting. It was a wild, wild shoot. Dido looked borderline-scared sometimes during that shoot. I was playing this crazy, obsessed lunatic fan, and this was her first acting thing. She'd look at me like, "Are you being serious right now?" It was pretty crazy. Dre co-directing it was huge for me. I've listened to his music from the time I was a young teenager all the way up until now. The guy's a legend. He's a genius... You just feel the greatness around. He's smart, and he knows what he's doing. It's the same feeling you get when you're around Spielberg. You just know that they're something special.</td></tr><tr readability=11><td>20</td><td>(2012, on being a former teen heartthrob) Well, it was something that was really hard to break out of. As soon as I got to 17 and 18 years old and I wasn't playing these teen roles anymore, it was hard to transition. So I thought I was going to do the weirdest stuff I could possibly do. Stuff that was edgier and alternative, like Idle Hands and SLC Punk! and the "Stan" video. I wanted to get out of that kind of teen-idol thing. So far it's worked. Now I'm doing another transition from the college roles and all that to young doctor, young lawyer, young cop. It's been quite a journey.</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>21</td><td>There are tons of things that have been written about me on the Internet that are total crap.
