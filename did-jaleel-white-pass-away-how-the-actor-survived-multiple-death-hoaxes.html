How the Actor Survived Multiple Death Hoaxes</h1></header><section class=post-content><pre class=wp-block-code><code> Jaleel White is an American actor who is best known for playing the nerdy character Steve Urkel on the sitcom Family Matters. He is also a voice actor, producer, and writer. However, he has also been the victim of several death hoaxes over the years, which claimed that he had committed suicide or died of a heart attack. Is Jaleel White alive or not? The answer is yes, he is alive and well. Here is how he debunked the false rumors about his death. ## The 2006 Death Hoax The first death hoax involving Jaleel White appeared in 2006, when a fake Associated Press article circulated on the internet, stating that White had died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. The article used a photo of White from the film The Equalizer 2, in which he played a character who faked his own death. The article also quoted a fake tweet from former President Barack Obama, who supposedly paid tribute to White. ## The 2023 Death Hoax The second death hoax occurred in 2023, when another fake Associated Press article claimed that White had died of a heart attack. The article used the same photo of White from The Equalizer 2, and cited a fake source from the Los Angeles Police Department, who allegedly confirmed White's death. The article was widely shared and commented on by unsuspecting fans, until it was debunked by several fact-checking websites White also responded to the hoax on his social media accounts, saying that he was alive and healthy. He also thanked his fans for their concern and support, and urged them to be careful of what they read online. ## The Truth The truth is that Jaleel White is alive and thriving, and he is not letting the death hoaxes affect him. He is still working on new projects, such as the Netflix comedy series The Big Show Show, in which he plays a recurring role. He is also a host and executive producer of the Syfy game show Total Blackout. He is also a father to a daughter, Samaya, who was born in 2009. Jaleel White is not dead, but he is a living legend. He has entertained and inspired millions of people with his talent and charisma. He has proven that he is not only a great actor, but also a great human being. He is a survivor, and he is a hero. ```.</code></pre><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7Jfmbalecmao56dnGLEqbXTnmSpmaOoeqLDwLJkoaenYsGpsYyamq2nomLAtr7Voq2enF2iwq3AyKmjnmWUmq61tIyhppqwlah8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./david-mcknight-obituary-know-his-age-bio-wiki-net-worth-cause-of-death-more.html><span>←</span><span>David Mcknight Obituary: Know His Age, Bio, Wiki, Net Worth, Cause Of Death &amp;amp; More</span></a>
