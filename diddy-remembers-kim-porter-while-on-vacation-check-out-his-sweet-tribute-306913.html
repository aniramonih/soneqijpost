But she and Diddy’ve gotten a lot closer over the past 6 months or so, since Kim’s death because Lori was really close to Kim too.

She uplifts him.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>They added: ‘This has been one of the hardest times in Diddy’s life, if not the hardest, so anybody that can bring light to his life, he cherishes.
