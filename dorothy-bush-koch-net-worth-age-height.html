The same may be seen in her dedication to supporting many individuals, including her brother throughout his presidential runs.</p><p>But for a variety of reasons, she keeps her fortune a secret, making it difficult to estimate her annual income. Her estimated net worth as of <strong>December 2022 is $2 million.</strong></p><p>Being successful in life is one thing; sharing your success with those in society who are less fortunate is quite another. Many people automatically fold their hands when someone in need approaches. On the other hand, Dorothy is a very another tale. She is a beautiful woman who derives real fulfillment from helping others.</p><h2><span id=Where_was_Dorothy_Bush_Koch_born_Ethnicity_Nationality_Family_Education>Where was Dorothy Bush Koch born?
