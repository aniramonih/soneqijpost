Though the Descendants star has kept quiet about it and not admitted to going under the knife, fans believe that she has had rhinoplasty, boob jobs, and lip fillers because Dove Cameron before plastic surgery looks like a completely different person. Check out her before and after pictures!&nbsp;</strong></p><p><b>Chloe Celeste Hosterman</b> mostly known as<a href=# rel=noopener><b> Dove Olivia Cameron </b></a>(born on January 15, 1996) is an American <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>actress</strong></a> and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>singer</strong></a> who is most recognized and loved for her portrayal of the dual role of the namesake characters in the Disney Channel comedy series Liv and Maddie. She won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in Children's Programming for her performance in the series.</p><p>The actress has also appeared in the Descendants film series as Mal. In 2016, she starred in the NBC live television musical Hairspray Live!, for which she was nominated for an MTV Movie Award for Best Musical Moment for her performance of You Can't Stop the Beat.</p><p>Though the Disney star is much loved, she has not been able to avoid plastic surgery speculations. In fact, she is always plagued with rumors of cosmetic surgery procedures as her appearance is very much altered. Dove Cameron before plastic surgery looks like a completely different person.</p><p>Previously, we touched on the&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener>plastic surgery</a></strong> efforts of <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Leah Remini</strong></a> and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Alysia Magen</strong></a>.</p><h2>Dove Cameron Before Plastic Surgery: The Descendants Cast Is Believed To Have Had Rhinoplasty, Boob Job, and Lip Filler!</h2><p><strong>Dove Cameron</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@dovecameron</a>) is suspected to have undergone plastic surgery including <strong>rhinoplasty</strong>, <strong>breast augmentation</strong>, and <strong>lip fillers</strong>.</p><p>Dove Cameron is one of the prettiest actresses of her time who has a big fanbase she garnered from her Disney days. They have known her since she was like 17. Having been in the public eyes since she was that young, it would be foolish to expect that she would not face plastic surgery speculations, especially now that her appearance has changed so much.</p><p>The Dove Cameron before plastic surgery and the Dove Cameron after plastic surgery do not look the same at all. It's hard to believe they are the same person.</p><p>Because her face has changed drastically, they wonder what plastic surgery procedures she has had. There have been many speculations about her cosmetic surgery but the Descendants star has decided to remain silent about it. But even though she has not admitted to having any plastic surgery, the obvious changes on her face prove that she has gone under the knife to change her appearance. Mostly, she is suspected of having rhinoplasty, boob job, fillers, etc.</p><p>When looking at her <a href=# rel=noopener>before</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>after</a> photos, the first thing that people usually notice is the difference in her nose. The tip of her nose has become smaller than before and also it bends down a bit. She definitely had a rhinoplasty to achieve this. Rhinoplasty or nose job is a kind of plastic surgery procedure to alter the shape and size of the nose. But except for the speculation by her fans after looking at her before and after photos, besides her appearance, there is no concrete proof as the actress has chosen not to confirm no deny those rumors.</p><p>Another plastic surgery procedure that the fans suspected the Boyfriend <a href=# rel=noopener>singer</a> of having is boob augmentation. Even though there is not much difference in the size of her boobs, some of her fans believe that she might have gone for small implants to enhance her breast size since Dove’s boobs tend to stay the same regardless of her weight.</p><p>Dove Cameron has also most likely had a lip filler. Her fans have also noticed that the size of her lips has changed. Her lips look plumper than they were before. But like others, she has not admitted to lip fillers and this is just speculation.</p><p>1.57m tall singer's doll-like baby face also might be the reason why some people think she has had face implants. The 26-year-old actress is still young and because she has one of the most beautiful faces in Hollywood, people believe that she has had work done on her face. However, the actress has not talked about having plastic surgery even once. Whether she had cosmetic surgery or not there is no denying that she is one of the most attractive actresses right now.</p><h2>Dove Cameron's Life Has Changed Since She Came Out As Queer!</h2><p><strong>Dove Cameron</strong>'s life has turned upside down ever since she came out as queer in 2020, and then again in 2021. The singer and actor <a href=# rel=noopener>came</a> up to E! News on her path since publicly revealing her sexual orientation. The Boyfriend singer said that the narrative in which a queer person speaking about their identity is as though sitting on a secret their whole life didn't apply to her because she had always known who she was and it wasn't a revelation. Ever since she could remember, she knew she was queer.</p><p class="css-18vfmjb et3p2gv0">Dove has also opened up about her fears and apprehensions before coming out. The Descendants actress wants to share the happiness she's discovered since coming out with her fans and supporters. She believes that social media has changed dramatically in terms of activism and community involvement, and she encourages her younger fans to support LGBT friends and participate in queer debates. She also gave a piece of advice for the young generation,</p><p>"Create an open space within you, within your community, within your circles, and that's enough."</p><p>Dove Cameron originally came out in 2020, when she described herself as <strong>Super Queer</strong> during an Instagram live. The former Disney actress came out as queer in a cover <a href=# rel=noopener>story</a> for Gay Times, where she discussed how her We Belong video was accused of queerbaiting.</p><p><strong>Visit&nbsp;<a href=#>House & Whips</a>&nbsp;for more&nbsp;<a href=#>interesting stories</a> about your favorite celebs.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6rApq3Nna6hoaCoe6S7zGibqK6VYrCiucSrpqdloKGutMDInGSsraKcsrPFjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./demon-slayer-why-can-nezuko-go-in-the-sun-how-did-nezuko-conquer-the-sun-html.html><span>←</span><span>Demon Slayer Why Can Nezuko Go In The Sun How Did Nezuko Conquer The Sun</span></a>
