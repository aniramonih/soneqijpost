They are very protective of others especially those they love. As protective as they are of others, they are also looking for someone to protect them and act as a parental figure. This nurturing quality also makes it hard to be open with others. They are generally good parents and role models for the young.</p><p>advertisement</p><p>advertisement</p><p>These people keep their innermost feelings and thoughts hidden away only letting those closest to them see who they are. They can be very shy when it comes to relationships. When they feel close to someone they will show how much knowledge and wisdom they have and how generous their nature is. When they do decide to share themselves with someone they are serious and committed. Their shy nature will attract them to protective partners.</p><p>They have great visions for how they want their life to go and are determined and focused on making their dreams come true. Mut persons know how to magnetically attract others with their charm and patience. They can be good listeners even if they don’t always agree with what they are hearing.</p><p>advertisement</p><p>advertisement</p><h3>Thinkers</h3><p>The <strong>Mut zodiac sign</strong> is a logical, practical thinker. When they do decide to express who they are they have already calculated the pros and cons and how they will do it. They are rational thinkers and it can be hard to convince them that they are wrong. They use their vast knowledge to achieve their goals.</p><p><strong>Mut</strong> people are honest and yet mysterious. They are interested in subjects like spiritual growth, philosophy and mysticism. People may not be able to always figure them out because of their reserved personality and quiet nature. Their caring nature will make them do well in careers of law, social work, nursing, or teaching.</p><p>advertisement</p><p>advertisement</p><h2><strong>Negative Traits</strong></h2><p>The <strong>Mut Egyptian horoscope sign</strong> can become too involved in relationships. Once they decide to open themselves up to another, they are very committed and serious. If things don’t work out this can lead to them being very disappointed.</p><p>They can go through periods of sadness, depression, and melancholy. They can also be secretive and withdrawn. Mut persons can be very rigid in personal relationships and can come across as unromantic and unfeeling. They can seem impersonal and cold.</p><p>They have a hard time showing affection and may be overprotective of their partners. These people feel that once they let their feelings be known they are too vulnerable and susceptible to being hurt.</p><p>They are easy to anger with tempers that can explode at any time. When angered they can also go into an aggressive silence. They have high ideals that they are not willing to be flexible on. This can isolate others and make them feel like they are constrained to only one way of thinking.</p><p>Because they are so rigid with their thoughts they can be overly critical of others, but they dislike being criticized by others.</p><h2><strong>Mut Symbolism</strong></h2><h3><strong>Lucky Color:</strong></h3><p>The lucky color for the Egyptian goddess Mut sign is <strong>Red and brown.</strong></p><h3><strong>Sacred Animal:</strong></h3><p>The sacred animal for this sign is the <strong>Vulture</strong>.</p><h3><strong>Egyptian Astrology Compatibility</strong>:</h3><p>This Egyptian sign is compatible with <strong>Amon-Ra</strong> and <strong>Thoth</strong>.</p><h3><strong>Appearance:</strong></h3><p>It is of a woman with the wings of a vulture.</p><h3><strong>Corresponding Western Zodiac Sign:</strong></h3><p>The associated zodiac sign is <strong>Scorpio</strong>.</p><h3><strong>Polarity:</strong></h3><p>The polarity for the Mut sign is <strong>feminine</strong>.</p><p><strong>See Also:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tMHNrKCgpqNjvLOzjp6esqiknq6vecCsq6unnKS0unnMrqto</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michaela-conlin-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Michaela Conlin Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
