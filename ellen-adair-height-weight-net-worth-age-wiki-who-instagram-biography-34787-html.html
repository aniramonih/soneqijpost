But I am so proud of the @Brewers for deciding not to play their game tonight, along with the @Bucks & the NBA, in the wake of the shooting of #Jacobblake, and the deaths of two protesters in Kenosha. I am more proud that the @Reds, @Padres, @Mariners, @Giants & @Dodgers have followed suit. Obviously, I’ve been glad to see MLB embrace the Black Lives Matter movement this season, whether that means more players being outspoken, ceremonies on Opening Day, or the Players Alliance. (If you don’t know it, it’s an organization created by Black professional baseball players to advocate for more opportunities in the Black community.) I personally refrain from criticizing the ways in which people or organizations speak out, because a) I don’t think it’s my place; b) we’re all still learning, and any amount of trying, of simply not being silent, is better than nothing, and c) I prefer to use my energy to advocate for actions than to tear down other efforts. But it’s true that a lot of the things from MLB as an organization felt safe because they felt sanctioned. Some of it wasn’t that different from every organization from whom you’ve ever purchased anything sending you an email to let you know that they think Black Lives Matter and now, more than ever, would you like to buy their product? And maybe I’m wrong, but this feels different. These players made the decision not to play, not the organization, knowing that a forfeit and a loss might be the cost. Knowing that many, many fans will work themselves into a fury over it. So, I just want to say that I support them. And, given my very unhealthy love of baseball, I’m so glad to see it aligning itself more with the NBA in player activism. It’s always complex and it’s never perfect, but this is a moment when I actually feel happy to be alive in 2020. And, of course: hold the officers who shot Jacob Blake accountable. And, of course: arrest the officers who killed Breonna Taylor.</a></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ellen Adair</a> (@ellenadairg)’in paylaştığı bir gönderi (26 Ağu, 2020, 8:12ös PDT)</p><p><br>She remains at a stature of 5 feet and 3 inches.
