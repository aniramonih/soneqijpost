Musk didn’t hold back when speaking about what Bezos needs to do to get his coins up in order to knock him from being the wealthiest man in the world. He advised that Bezos should devote more time to his space company Blue Origin and “less time in the hot tub” if he wants to lead in the billionaire space travel race—and he should “work harder.”’</p><p>View this post on Instagram</p><p>A post shared by The Shade Room (@theshaderoom)</p><p>Elon Musk also said that Jeff Bezos ‘does not seem to be willing to spend mental energy getting into the details of engineering’ and that while Bezos possesses ‘reasonably good engineering aptitude…he takes himself a bit too seriously.’</p><p>Someone said: ‘First his lil spat with Zuck, now he’s bickering with Jeff.
