Damn, does this woman have ANY style? Anyway, we’ve been talking about Emma recently because she seems to have suddenly dumped Evan Peters (yet again, for the millionth time) and <a href=#>immediately jumped off</a> with… Garrett Hedlund. They’ve been pap’d together a few times, like this stroll from last week:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Over 60 exclusive new pics! Emma Roberts & Garrett Hedlund pack on the PDA: <a href=#>https://t.co/kV8Wu9AqEm</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/WrKInnKAva</a></p><p>— ExtraTV (@extratv) <a href=#>April 10, 2019</a></p><p>The fact that Garrett is willingly participating in this kind of “look at us, we’re in a new relationship!” thing bugs me. Especially since it’s Emma Roberts, who… well, strikes me as a very high-strung, high-maintenance kind of person, let’s say it that way. She was once briefly arrested for assaulting Evan Peters, and she was also “the reason” why Rachel Bilson and Hayden Christensen are no longer together. She “do what she want,” yes, but it’s weird to me that Garrett is into it. And apparently he IS very into it.</p><p>Emma Roberts and Garrett Hedlund aren’t rushing things when it comes to their relationship. A source tells PEOPLE the two are taking it slow after Roberts, 28, broke off her engagement with longtime love Evan Peters.</p><p>“Emma is newly single and neither she nor Garrett are in the right headspace to be in a serious relationship,” says the source. “They’re just having fun hanging out and hooking up.”</p><p>Reps for Roberts and Hedlund did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s requests for comment.</p><p><a href=#>[From People]</a></p><p>They’re not interested in a serious relationship? The pap strolls say something different. But sure, whatever. Maybe this is the game. Does Garrett know it’s a game? Is he just having fun and not taking it seriously? I hope so.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/BGUS_1543892_006.jpg alt="Actress Emma Roberts spends her Tuesday hanging out in Los Feliz" width=480 sizes="(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of Backgrid.<br></p><a href=#><img width=108 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/BGUS_1541784_007-108x150.jpg alt sizes="(max-width: 108px) 100vw, 108px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img width=115 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/BGUS_1543892_006-115x150.jpg alt sizes="(max-width: 115px) 100vw, 115px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmb2lnbYF1e8SmpJqXoqSvpr7TrJagmaKnsrXAvqGcnaSlo7GgrdGelqOto6msqa3VoqWgl5aqu6C0wKeeoqaXlLy2wL6hpqijmaO0oMHPaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./easton-stick-parents-meet-shelly-and-mike-stick.html><span>←</span><span>Easton Stick Parents: Meet Shelly And Mike Stick</span></a>
