He is the one who worked on Twitter for 6 years. Eric was an android software developer on Twitter.</p><p>According to him, he made so many improvements for the betterment of twitter usage in android. But why he got fired, the story remains. Let’s get to know the mystery of this mishap.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why did Eric Frohnhoefer get fired?</h2><p>A software developer at Twitter who had a Twitter feud with <a href=#>Elon Musk</a> told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CNN</a> that his friend had to show him Musk’s post that said “<strong>he’s fired</strong>” to realize that he had been let go.</p><p>Upon hearing of his dismissal, engineer Eric Frohnhoefer tweeted, “<strong>no one even contacted me from Twitter</strong>.”</p><p>After an argument with Musk on Monday, the Twitter founder announced Frohnhoefer’s dismissal in a tweet that has since been deleted. Sometime later, Frohnhoefer tweeted, “<strong>Guess it is official now</strong>.” alongside a picture of his locked Mac.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>&nbsp;The argument began when Musk apologized “<strong>for Twitter being incredibly slow in many places</strong>,” to which Frohnhoefer replied, “<strong>false,</strong>” claiming he had spent the previous six years developing Twitter for Android.</p><p>Musk wrote back to Frohnhoefer, urging him to “<strong>If I’m wrong, someone set me straight. Is this a good number, or not?</strong>” and then another response added, “<strong>Unfortunately, Android’s implementation of Twitter is painfully slow. Is there anything you’ve done to correct the situation?</strong>“</p><p>Frohnhoefer responded to Musk in a string of deleted tweets by claiming, “<strong>we have done a bunch of work to increase performance</strong>” and that there is “<strong>plenty of potential for improvements</strong>.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>&nbsp;In an interview with CNN on Monday night, after his dismissal, Frohnhoefer claimed that he was “<strong>ready to give</strong>” working under Musk’s <a href=#>leadership</a> “<strong>a try</strong>” and that he was in the “<strong>wait-and-see camp</strong>.”</p><p>While on the news program, he confirmed that “<strong>everything that has been stated is real</strong>,” calling working for Twitter while Musk is in charge a “<strong>complete sh-t show</strong>.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Eric Frohnhoefer’s reaction emoji on Twitter</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Musk tweeted the news of the engineer’s dismissal. On the other hand, the fired worker tweeted a smiley face shortly after the news of his dismissal had broken.</p><p>The whole time they’ve been arguing, Frohnhoefer has been saying that he could leave Twitter for several reasons. He said LinkedIn had “<strong>never been more popular</strong>” and that a Reddit programmer had publicly messaged him to offer him a job there instead of on Twitter.</p><p>Frohnhoefer and another Twitter developer seem to have had enough of Musk’s autocratic management style.</p><p>According to Bloomberg, Ben Leib, a Twitter engineer who had worked there for ten years, was <strong>dismissed on Sunday</strong> after reacting to the identical Musk tweet.</p><p>According to The Verge, the tone of Leib’s post indicates rising camaraderie among Twitter’s dissatisfied remaining personnel against the hatred of Musk’s managerial style.</p><p>Stay Connected with us for updates regarding twitter because until Elon Musk Is here on Twitter,<strong> every day is with new chaotic news.</strong></p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCx0aKaZp6ipLWvtM6enZ6qXZm8rq3Ip5ZvZaedxm60xGaeqKxdm7azscNo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./does-phoebe-tonkin-have-siblings-phoebe-tonkin-siblings-age-and-more-1091649.html><span>←</span><span>Does Phoebe Tonkin Have Siblings?
