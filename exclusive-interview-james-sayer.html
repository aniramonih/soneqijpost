How would you describe your sound?
I’d describe it as feel-good music! Music to make people sing, dance and clap their hands!

<span>Billy Koelling</span></p><h1>Exclusive: Interview with James Sayer</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>James Sayer is a singer-songwriter with a sound that can rival any classic rockstar. His unique sound in a world of pop sets him above the rest. CelebMix chatted with Sayer to talk about his sound, inspirations, and what he has planned for the future.</p><p><strong>How would you describe your sound?</strong></p><p>I’d describe it as feel-good music! Music to make people sing, dance and clap their hands!</p><p><strong>Tell us about your new single “Sweet Baby Jane”</strong></p><p>Sure! This is my second single and it’s been so fun to make! I wanted to keep the vintage-pop sound of my first single ‘Taking Back My Love’ so we recorded everything live based around me being on an old upright piano. I also added gospel singers to the sound of this track, which was such a pleasure to do and an honour to hear such amazing voices on my music. The story of the song was inspired from the classic Motown/Soul dance hall era. Hopefully, you can imagine yourself dancing to this song in the 1960’s or 2016!</p><p><strong>What sort of influences shaped your music?</strong></p><p>I’m a big fan of old rock n roll/soul music – so artists like The Rolling Stones, Van Morrison, Sam Cooke and Rod Stewart. Being a piano player, my biggest influence is Elton John – his playing has had such an impact on my own piano playing – I love hearing all the gospel/soul elements in his playing.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/exclusive-interview-with-james-sayer-02-300x300.jpg alt="Exclusive: Interview with James Sayer 2" width=300 height=300 sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>What are you looking forward to with your music?</strong></p><p>I’m looking forward to playing live as much as possible and then getting in the studio and recording new music. I think that has to be any musicians dream!</p><p><strong>Anything in the horizon? Tour or new music?</strong></p><p>I just did a headline London and Birmingham show and after I’ve finished promoting this new single I will be doing a solo show in London, pretty soon. Next year I will be doing a headline tour with my band around the UK and also heading over to Brazil and some European countries to play a couple of solo shows.</p><p>If you’d like to find out more about James, you can head to his website at&nbsp;<a href=#>http://www.jamessayermusic.com</a></p><p>Do you love James?
