Charlie had noticed there was a second fire in the house’s garage and so he went to go check it out. Bode was trying to convince him to come back when they were both knocked off their feet once the garage blew up. It turns out the fire had spread to the heater. It created a small explosion, but both Bode and his buddy Charlie were alright. They were checked out by the paramedics. They were cleared. They were back on their feet when the homeowner arrived and demand that no convicts be around her stuff.</p><p>Only she couldn’t dictate which firefighters saved her belongings. The convicts got to stay. They helped collect some of her items off the burning grass and Bode could have stolen from her. He chose not to. He handed everything over to Manny at the end of the call. He remembered Manny being impressed by the watch he found. It, therefore, didn’t make sense that a watch would go missing when they were returned to the homeowner. The police later came by the fire camp. They spoke to Manny. They asked him if he saw a watch and he was responding to them while handling an issue with his daughter.</p><p>Gabriella was trying to find an apartment. There was just one problem with that. No one wanted to rent to her because of her poor credit score. Gabriella knows how to handle her money and so the only issue could be the credit card she allowed her father to use. She checked up on the card. It’s overextended. It’s past due. Manny hasn’t been keeping on top of it and she was forced to contact him about it. He told her that he had it handled. But he didn’t. Manny was heavily in debt. He couldn’t afford to pay off the credit card and so he was ruining Gabriella’s credit now. And there could be more.</p><p>The police came around because the same watch that Bode found had also been reported missing. The convicts had all of their bunks checked and secret cell phones were confiscated. There were also some vape pens that were confiscated as well. They went through everything and even questioned the women too. Yet, they never found the Lurvati watch. They didn’t even tell the convicts what they were looking for until Bode demanded answers or else he was going to involve his lawyer. And once they named that expensive watch, Bode remembered finding it and he remembered handing it to Manny and so he wondered if Manny had stolen it.</p><p>Bode could have dropped Manny in it. Only he didn’t. He talked to Rebecca about it and he told her that he has faith that whoever stole the watch would confess. Rebecca on the other hand thought he should snitch. She said that would help him get out faster. She firmly believed Manny stole the watch. He stole cars. It makes sense that he would go back to stealing. It’s what he knows. They didn’t know about his money troubles and yet they still thought it was him. If it was him, he created a lot of problems for the prisoners. They could all be sent back to prison over that missing watch and Bode couldn’t go back inside.</p><p>Bode has to leave prison at the first opportunity. His mom was sick and she needed him. Sharon even found out about the missing watch and she wanted to help. She offered to buy the owner another watch, but she got turned down. The watch wasn’t just expensive. It was an heirloom that’s been in the family for generations. Sharon was high as a kite after taking some medicinal candy and even she understood that the watch meant something to the owner. Sharon helped the homeowner fix up her yard. She received additional help from her friend Dr. Lily Crawford. Lily was Jake’s mom. And eventually, the watch was found.</p><p>Manny didn’t take it. He had every reason to do so and he hadn’t. Which Bode didn’t know until he confronted him. Bode didn’t want the others to be sent back to prison for something they didn’t do and so he told Manny that he would confess to the crime if Manny doesn’t do it himself, but he got a text while they were talking and he told Bode that the watch was found. Bode ended up regretting how he confronted Manny only what was he supposed to think. He remembered handing that watch to him. He remembered Manny being impressed by it. Then the watch went missing. How? How did it go missing from the time he handed it to Manny to the time it was found?</p><p>The homeowner stopped by the camp. She apologized to the convicts because she found the watch all burnt up on the lawn and she only found it with Sharon and Lily’s help. She even showed them the watch. It was a less impressive version of what Bode found. It turns out there were two watches on that lawn. Bode later went to Manny to apologize and Manny forgave him. Manny also filled out an art class form for Bode. He can get out of prison sooner if he gets educational credits. And so Bode thanked Manny for always believing in him.</p><p>Bode also did some rather silly. It could put his parole at risk. Bode had a questionable night with Rebecca. There’s no telling how far they went. The female prisoners weren’t supposed to fraternize with the male prisoners. And so they were breaking all the rules with what they were doing.</p><p>But they weren’t alone in breaking rules. Manny was so heavily in debt that he thought turning back to gambling was the answer and so he might find himself worse off than before.</p><p>And Gabriella found a way around her bad credit score. She was going to move in with her boyfriend. He asked and she said yes. It happened after a bad day on the job in which they lost someone and so they needed some good news and moving in together was it.</p><p>THE END</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWtnlp6%2FpnnCqKynrKKuerOxwpqnZmliYn1zeZFrZKydkai8r3mQZpypoaOksaZ5lmafmqigrnq1u4yhnKWoXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./felecia-faye-richey-tysin-bentley-found-dead.html><span>←</span><span>Felecia Faye Richey, Tysin &amp;amp; Bentley found dead: Death of Mom, Two Sons Found in Camper on Motocross</span></a>
