The Cast of Hamilton</h4><p></p><p>The cast of the hit musical&nbsp;Hamilton&nbsp;got down to “Let’s Go Crazy.” The musical director, Alex Lacamoire, put together the number earlier in the day. Lin-Manuel Miranda, the star of the show, tweeted afterwards:</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Good night guys.<br>Today we laughed, we cried, we mourned, we danced.<br>What more could we ask of that electric word, life?</p><p>— Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) <a href=#>April 22, 2016</a></p><h4>4. Jennifer Hudson and&nbsp;The Color Purple</h4><p></p><p>Another tribute&nbsp;from a Broadway cast, Jennifer Hudson led the cast of&nbsp;The Color Purple&nbsp;through a rendition of the song “Purple Rain.” The resulting performance is incredible. Full of emotion, this is one that will be remembered.</p><h4>3. LCD Soundsystem at Coachella</h4><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nY2xaGbfSM</p><p>On Friday night’s headlining performance at Coachella, LCD Soundsystem sang Prince’s “Controversy” to honor the late singer. Backed by an entirely purple stage, the bittersweet performance concluded a day of remembering a music legend at Coachella, with artists from Ellie Goulding to Jack Ü paying tribute.</p><h4><strong>2. Mariah Carey</strong></h4><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdP624-In50</p><p>Before her emotional performance of “One Sweet Day” in Paris, Carey dedicated the performance to Prince, saying that:</p><p>“He was a friend to me, too, and he talked me through some times I really, really needed somebody.”</p><h4>1. Mumford and Sons</h4><p></p><p>At their show in St. Paul, Minnesota, Mumford and Sons sang a folksy version of Prince’s “Nothing Compares 2 U.” Lead-man Marcus Mumford also dedicated the entire show to Prince after their first song.</p><p><strong>What Prince tributes did we miss?
