Could Zarin be considering going back as a full-time cast member?</p><p>While speaking with Life & Style at WEtv’s Love After Lockup screening, Zarin talked about what it was like to reconnect with Frankel when she unexpectedly showed up to pay her respects at her husband Bobby’s funeral in January 2018. Zarin says that it was nice to see Frankel again, and she’s sorry they didn’t get to talk much afterward.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>The <a href=# rel=nofollow>#RHONY</a> alum is settling into her new abode with her new love.<a href=# rel=nofollow>https://t.co/gg5VgWGdRj</a></p><p>— Bravo (@BravoTV) <a href=# rel=nofollow>August 10, 2019</a></p><p>She added that she’s talked to Frankel a few times since their brief meeting, but they aren’t close friends like they were before their falling out.</p><p>“You know what, I’m so busy doing my own thing. You know, we’ve communicated a few times, but nothing more than that,” Zarin revealed. “And I only wish her the best, I really do. It’s been a rough year for her too, you know, after the death of Dennis.”</p><p>Frankel lost her on-again, off-again boyfriend <a href=#>Dennis Shields</a> to an apparent drug overdose just eight months after Zarin lost her husband to cancer.</p><p>The 55-year-old says that RHONY did “amazing things” for her, and she would like to go back to the show in some way. But, at the same time, it’s a “scary proposition” because her boyfriend Gary Brody is “dangerous” and “he’s gonna get me in trouble.”</p><p>Zarin explained that her biggest fear about returning to the show full-time is the negative effect it could possibly have on her relationship with Brody. She says she doesn’t want to ruin the relationship and TV can do that, so it’s probably not the best idea to rejoin the cast.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>If this monster returns to <a href=# rel=nofollow>#RHONY</a> will be the next franchise I cut. Leave things be. Although I’d love to see Bethenny feast on her. <a href=# rel=nofollow>https://t.co/Cc2xJYCaI4</a></p><p>— Plastic Truth (@RSevinson) <a href=# rel=nofollow>August 16, 2019</a></p><p>However, she does enjoy the friend role because it is a lot more fun, and being on the show was never about the money for her. She says if she does return as a friend of the cast, then it was meant to be.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The Season 11 RHONY reunion special just wrapped up last month. New episodes of Real Housewives of New York City will return to Bravo in 2020.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeWpL%2BusdFmqaGnnq56tMDAq2SjoZyherut0aKlZqGjYsC1tculZK2qqZ67qHnTqGSmmZuaeqmx0WapnqSRqbawutKhoKllp57BqXnBnquhnZ6jxm6y0ZqlpJ2cYq5uwMeipaBlY2Z%2FcoOUaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./five-touching-tributes-prince.html><span>←</span><span>Five Touching Tributes to Prince</span></a>
