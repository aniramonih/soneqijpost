The recent midterm election coverage was easily one of the finest nights of special coverage he produced throughout his career. And he was the ultimate producer: breaking news, politics, and special events — there was no steadier or more trusted colleague to be within the control room during the most consequential events of our time, and his incisiveness and passion for news made our work better.”</span></strong></span></p><p><span>Alan started at the network when Fox News Channel launched in 1996.</span></p><p><span>Scott and Wallace wrote in the memo,&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><strong><span>“He would joke that he was a guy from ‘real Brooklyn’ and rose through the ranks to become a writer, producer, showrunner, and eventually Senior Vice President of News & Politics, overseeing all political coverage. His sharp sense of humor and quick wit throughout his incredible career also led to the many lifelong friendships he made here.”</span></strong></span></p><p><span><strong><span>“Our deepest condolences are with them and Alan’s entire extended family as we collectively mourn the loss of a wonderful man.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong></span></p><p><span>Alan was survived by his wife Rachael and his children Ben and Olivia.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/latestinbollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Alan-Komissaroff-Family.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikkamytMDIp5mopJyuxLC7w2eaqKVfm7y5ec2erqxlla2ypMHToq2eZZGhrq95yqikoqujlr%2BwssVmm6Kdo2K8p3nHnpirrF2WwbWtwqRm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./719837-madisyn-shipman-playboy.html><span>←</span><span>Former Nickelodeon Star Madisyn Shipman Speaks On Raunchy Playboy Shoot</span></a>
