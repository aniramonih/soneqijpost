She is such a natural talker that it really was an effortless audition session. She tested against six other women. There were seven women in total. And she truly blew everyone away. All great personalities aren’t natural talkers. She has a definitive opinion and doesn’t mind sharing it. Whether they were talking about celebrities, parenting, or politics, she was so well-read on every issue.’</p><p>Of course, they also mentioned that there was a lot of chemistry between her and the other hosts as well so the new season of The Real is bound to be a joy to watch!</p><p>The insider also mentioned that ‘This is not the first talk show she was up for. She actually booked a CBS talk show opposite of Jerry O’Connell. The show was in development back in 2014 and shelved 2015.’</p><p>Furthermore, they told the same news outlet that Garcelle Beauvais was also up for a The Talk job that eventually went to Eve instead.</p><p>Finally, Garcelle hosted Hollywood Today Live alongside Ross Mathews.</p><p>That show, however, ended in 2017 after it lost its funding due to the production company being sold to another company.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Are you looking forward to seeing Garcelle Beauvais on The Real in the upcoming season?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeXlr%2BksculnGaalZbCt63IrGSrnaCkv7Wxw6WwZpqcmsRurdaasGadppq%2FurvNnmSdraKeu6h5x56pZpuYmrqqv9OrsGaslajBbrLOq2StoJViv6aty2abnqyRnrm0eZNsZ3FrZ2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./zulekha-haywood-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Zulekha Haywood Bio (Wiki)</span></a>
