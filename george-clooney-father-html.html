He also has a daughter, George's sister, Adelia Clooney. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>It is natural for everyone to simply accept that Nick was a great father because his son, George, is not just a titan of show business, he is a responsible member of the society who believes in giving back.&nbsp;</p><p>As Nick himself explained, his son has always been one to help those who had less power than he did and challenge those who had more.&nbsp;</p><p>"I think that's a good philosophy of life," the proud father said during an interview with NBC News.&nbsp;"It's inconvenient often, but that has not stopped him." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The son has always maintained in the public sphere that he was greatly influenced by his patriarch, but Nick will not have it.&nbsp;</p><p>Nick was adamant that he did not teach George to become what he has become.&nbsp;</p><p>"I can only enjoy it," he said of his son's body of work.&nbsp;"What we have to give him great credit for, is his great talent&nbsp;that brought him great power, and he decided to use it in this way. I just love that." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Nick Clooney Refused Credit for Son's Success</h2><p>In another interview with <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Huff Post</a>, Nick pressed on his argument further. He went as far as to claim that the influence of parents was some sort of overblown statistic.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He was of the idea that people came into the world as the people they were going to be.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>"They come out of the womb that way," the humble father insisted.&nbsp;"We have very little to do with it."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>I tell you, if he were a serial killer, this would be an entirely different conversation you and I would be having, and I'd be running away from you.</p><p>He went on to gush about his film star son and shared that regardless of the situation, his son would make a call and return the call.&nbsp;</p><h2>Nick Clooney Has Respect for His Son</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The seasoned journalist admitted that he too would cower behind a closed door for a few weeks if he was dealt some of the circumstances his son had to go through.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>"So I salute him. He's turned out to be kind of a great guy," Nick said of his son.&nbsp;</p><p>Then citing how George had a sense of irony and justice from when he was very little, the father began an anecdote from when the actor was 3.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Apparently, during a visit to their grandparents' place, little George was playing with a puppy and the puppy snapped at him.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>This young man's sense of justice was so straightforward that he carried the pup and bit it too.</p><p>"What a perfect sense of justice," Nick said with a laugh.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJ%2BVpL%2BosYyco6innprGbrLArZ%2Beql6dwa64</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gemma-chan-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Gemma Chan Net Worth 2024</span></a>
