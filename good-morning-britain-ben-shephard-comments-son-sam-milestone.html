It seems like only yesterday he was barely as tall as the letter box, now he barely gets through the front door!!!</p><p id=egHAYRy3uGC data-wc=50>"To anyone else sending their younguns off for the last day of school- where has the time gone??? Good news is we don't look a day older right??? Good luck to them all for their exams and whatever comes next! By the way, he never did grow into the shorts!!"</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Ben Shephard makes rare comments about wife Annie during GMB appearance</figure><p id=eY_gnP8ITa data-wc=70>Fans were quick to react to the presenter's nostalgic post, flooding the comments section with their own experiences of parenthood. "Best of luck to Sam for his exams. And what a cute picture!" wrote one. "Feeling this today about our 'little one' on [the] last official day," added another. "Bless, it's scary how quick the time goes by, hope they all get on good," a third well-wisher wrote.</p><p id=eZQ596OL0C data-wc=22><strong>Keep up with the latest celebrity stories<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Sign up to our HELLO!
