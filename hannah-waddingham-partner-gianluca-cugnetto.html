However, Waddingham’s fans must already be familiar with this fact, considering the pair have attended many public events together. Still, their first encounter and dating history remain a mystery.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Hannah-Waddingham-with-her-partner.jpg><p>Gianluca Cugnetto’s girlfriend often shares his pictures but makes sure not to reveal his face and avoids using tags.

Who knows, they might be planning on it.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Hannah_Waddinghams_Partner_Is_A_Hotelier></span>Hannah Waddingham’s Partner Is A Hotelier<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Hannah Waddingham’s partner comes from an entirely different field. The Italian man<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"> hails from</a> a family of restaurateurs. As reported by many articles,&nbsp;Gianluca is an accomplished hotelier who describes himself as a food & drinks guru.

Aside from that, previously, the food and drinks guru was the director at Le Meridien in Dubai and The Sheraton. Not only that, he also worked in the Maldives, the Caribbean, and London for seven years.</p><p>Nonetheless, Cugnetto seems to have accomplished considerable success in his career. He must also have amassed a hefty sum to his name.</p><p></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Father_Of_One_Lovely_Daughter></span>Father Of One Lovely Daughter<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The gorgeous actress and her partner welcomed their first baby, <strong>Kitty</strong>, in 2014. The pair are busy with their schedules and often travel to different places while working. Gianluca’s lady love often used to bring their child on the set.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Have baby,will travel!

(@hanwaddingham) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">December 15, 2014</a></p><p>Furthermore, Kitty was quite ill when she was young. Hannah Waddingham’s daughter was diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder called Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP). The condition causes inflammation of the small blood vessels. The actress <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">once shared</a> that although being a mother was her priority, she still wanted to work. When she got a chance to feature on Ted Lasso, whose shooting set was only thirty minutes away from her house. As such, she was able to be close to her precious baby, and Hannah later revealed that the series saved her.</p><p>The actress even put her Emmy award in Kitty’s room to remind her that she is never away from her unless it is for a good reason. It’s evident that the Cugnetto-Waddingham couple prioritizes their little girl and spends a lot of quality time together.</p><p>Nonetheless, Hannah Waddingham’s partner is doing well in his professional life. In addition, he is also enjoying a loving relationship with his gorgeous beau and is enjoying fatherhood. We wish the Ted Lasso star and her partner a lasting bond.</p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>For More Updates On&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Celebrity Babies</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Feuds</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Their Riches</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Siblings</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, And&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Entertainment</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, Keep In Touch With&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>eCelebritymirror.</span></strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidk5q5pq7RoquypZmnv7C%2BjZympmeVo8GmvtOaoKellaPBcLTAp6WaoF2srqWwyKeeoZmdYr2ivtOnnKtll56ur7jUnJhmm6Wcu6bA06hm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gwyneth-paltrow-is-deeply-loved-by-friends-post-split-bff-says-pic-2014188.html><span>←</span><span>Gwyneth Paltrow Is &amp;quot;Deeply Loved&amp;quot; by Friends Post-Split, BFF Says: Pic</span></a>
