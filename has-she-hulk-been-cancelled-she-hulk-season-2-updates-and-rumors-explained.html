So what chance does a moderately watched, divisive series like <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">She-Hulk: Attorney at Law</a></strong> have?</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=439 data-current-count=439 data-injectable=true>Well, that actually changes depending on who you ask. With Marvel Studios currently rethinking its streaming strategy following numerous less-than-successful releases — see Secret Invasion… and Secret Invasion — much of the long-term plan for the MCU on TV is known only to Kevin Feige and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">his inner sanctum, the Parliament</a>. That leaves the fates of the shows that have already aired first seasons even more in flux than before.</p><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=290 data-injectable=false>But while there’s simply radio silence on the odds of, say, Moon Knight getting a second season, we’re actively hearing conflicting things about whether She-Hulk could return or not. Your honor, may I present the evidence for the potential future of the superhero legal comedy.</p><h2 id=h-she-hulk-season-2-cancellations-claims-and-renewal-rumors-explained data-injectable=false>She-Hulk season 2 cancellations claims and renewal rumors, explained</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/She-Hulk-Marvel-Return.jpg><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>The Jade Giantess herself Tatiana Maslany got people talking when she casually dropped the bombshell on a Twitch stream that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she didn’t think She-Hulk season 2 was happening</a> .”I don’t think so,” the Jennifer Walters actress admitted. “I think we blew our budget, and Disney was like, ‘No thanks.’”</p><p data-characters=467 data-current-count=792 data-injectable=true>Honestly, this is something that most people had kind of guessed themselves. Last year, we learned that production on She-Hulk got exorbitantly expensive due to the fact that reshoots and changes of creative direction ensured its fully CGI lead character had to be animated over and over. The result was a nine-part half-hour show that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cost an eye-popping total of $225 million to make</a>. Put that together with Maslany’s comments and the case seems cut and dry.</p><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=352 data-injectable=false>And yet further intel argues that the star might’ve been a little hasty in her assessment of Shulkie’s future. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">io9</a>, Disney has yet to make a final decision on what’s to come of Marvel’s streaming shows as comeback kid CEO Bob Iger is still to give either a thumbs-up or down. As a supposed insider source revealed:</p><p>“Maslany’s comments are basically accurate, just lacking some context. That context is when CEO Bob Iger returned to Disney and changed much of Marvel’s direction, everything was reevaluated. So while Marvel works everything out, it’s not that a second season of She-Hulk has been completely abandoned. It just seems less likely than not at the moment.”</p><p data-characters=493 data-current-count=493 data-injectable=true>On the one hand, you might think that one of the first things Iger would’ve done after the strikes would be to cancel the series of the actress who accused him of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“outrageous” greediness and being “completely out of touch” last summer</a>, but actually this inside information does align with rumors we had previously heard. Upon the strikes’ conclusion in August 2023, rumors emerged that Marvel and Disney were in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">very early development on She-Hulk season 2</a>.</p><p data-characters=461 data-current-count=461 data-injectable=false>Still, it’s hard to shake the feeling that the word of the lead star of the show herself is more reliable than internet scuttlebutt. On the other hand, this is the same studio that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">didn’t even give the cast of Avengers: Endgame full scripts</a> in order to keep a lid on spoilers, so the actors of the MCU are often the last to know anything important. Somebody needs to break into Marvel Studios and go ask K.E.V.I.N. the robot what the real truth is.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yprdJmqqGdXZ3CrbeMm5yepl2Yrq%2BvxKWjnpxdqLWmeceuo6Rlo5qutLvNZmlmraCZrrWx0maYp5xdp8Kuu9GsZJ6woKGuqrrEnWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hannah-ferrier-fiance-net-worth-tattoos-smoking-body-measurements.html><span>←</span><span>Hannah Ferrier: Fianc, net worth, tattoos, smoking &amp;amp; body measurements</span></a>
