Spread the love! With Valentine’s Day just about two weeks away, it’s time to start thinking about what you’re going to wear. For Us, a big part of Valentine’s Day is about love, of course, but wearing red and pink clothing takes a close second. If you want to dress for the occasion but don’t have an outfit, we were thrilled to discover an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ultra-festive heart sweater</a> you can rock for Valentine’s Day and beyond!</p><p>This cardigan sweater checks all of your <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">style boxes</a> and then some — a big red heart on the back is bound to make the person behind you smile. (The soft, lightweight material will make you smile too!) Loose knit, a lightweight material and an oversized fit make this sweater ultra-comfortable and versatile, pairing perfectly with loungewear and jeans alike. It has an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">open front</a> which drapes to the mid-thigh (depending on how tall you are), plus a horizontal ribbed hem to frame your ‘fit. Airy lantern sleeves seal the cozy deal!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Tutorutor Oversized Love Pattern Cardigan Sweater</a> for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$33</a> (originally $39) at Amazon!
