<span>Billy Koelling</span></p><h1>History of Nicknames - General Name Discussion</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Hey, Berries! I saw that Behind the Name has the history of nicknames, so I wanted Nameberry to have one too!</p><p>Nicknames started with the phrase “an eke name”, with eke meaning also. Over time, it evolved into “a nekename”, which was translated as “nickname” to English speakers.</p><p>Some nicknames definitely puzzle some people, like how you get Billy from William and Peggy from Margaret (although you Berries are knowledgeable <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/forum.nameberry.com/images/emoji/apple/grin.png title=:grin: alt=:grin: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>). Hopefully this will help!</p>“Obvious” Nicknames<p>Some of the most common nicknames, especially in the English language, stem from either the first, middle, last syllable of the name. These names would, of course, be Lil from Lillian or Beth from Elizabeth. A majority of these shortened forms were also given an “ie” or “y” suffix, ending in Abby (Abigail) or Johnny (John). These names were common for both children and adults to say, as it was also a way to differentiate one person from another.</p><p>Examples:<br>Lilly / Lillie / Lily from Lillian<br>Gwen from Gwendolyn<br>Bea from Beatrice<br>Maddie from Madeline<br>Sam from Samuel<br>Johnny from John<br>Georgie from George</p>Rhyming Nicknames<p>Beginning in Medieval times, rhyming nicknames were a fun way children referred to each other. While William may have been primarily called Will, his friends might have rhymed and called him Bill. Just the same, a Margaret called Meg may have had her nickname rhymed to Peg, which then evolved into Peggy.</p><p>Examples<br>Margaret = Meg → Peg → Peggy<br>Rose = Rosie → Posie<br>Josephine = Josie → Posie<br>Robert = Rob → Bob → Bobby<br>William = Will → Bill → Billy</p>Cultural Nicknames<p>Whereas the above were common English practices, other cultures are known for their variety of nicknames.</p><p>The <strong>Russian</strong> culture tends to add many suffixes, among them being “-ya” and “-sha”. Among these would be Sasha from Aleksandr(a) and Anya from Anastasia. Some other suffixes used in that language would also be -ik, -nka, and -shka, according to Behind the Name.</p><p>The <strong>French</strong> add “-ette” and “-ine” to many feminine names— among others— to either turn a masculine name feminine or a sweet nickname. Examples would be Jean → Jeanette or Jeanine; Paul → Paulette or Pauline; and Georges → Georgine or Georgette. There are also nicknames that do not follow this pattern and are French: Coco, Fifi, Gigi, and Kiki. These are simply repeats of a syllable, such as Coco from Cosette, Gigi from Giselle, and so on.</p><p>Many <strong>Italian</strong> nicknames end in “ina”, “ino”, “etto”, and “etta”. Like the French, it can make a masculine name feminine. These suffixes are found in Luigina (from Luigi), Giuseppino (Giuseppe), and Marietta (Maria).</p><p>The <strong>Spanish</strong> language primarily includes nicknames ending in “ito” or “ita”, while other nicknames such as Isa (from Isabel) don’t necessarily follow this format, and are borrowed from the first syllable.</p><p>This is also an important thing to note:</p><img alt width=24 height=24 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/forum.nameberry.com/user_avatar/forum.nameberry.com/choupette/48/55437_2.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> choupette:<p>Spanish has some interesting nicknames that don’t necessarily resemble the original name e.g. <a href=#>Pepe</a> for <a href=#>José</a>, <a href=#>Nacho</a> for <a href=#>Ignacio</a> (the source of the name of the snack), <a href=#>Chema</a> for <a href=#>José</a> <a href=#>María</a>.</p><p>A bit of insight from <a class=mention href=#>@choupette</a>! ^</p><p>The <strong>Dutch</strong> sometimes use the suffixes “-je” or “-tje”, whereas many Eastern European languages use the Russian suffixes (see above)-- or “-ska” (Hungarian), “-uše” (Czech), and<br>“-ka”/“-ko”.</p><p>While some of these are commonly used as first names (Jeanette, Georgine, etc.), they historically evolved as nicknames, just as Lily is a stand-alone name that can also be short for Lilian or Liliana.</p><p>And here, a special feature on Croatian nicknames written by @/krijesnica</p>Croatian Nicknames<p><a href=#>My</a> country, Croatia, has a long tradition of nickname names as full names, as well as using nicknames on the regular. If your name is <a href=#>Magdalena</a>, there’s an extremely high chance you will be called Megi (prn. like Maggie) almost all of the time. <a href=#>Dorotea</a> will almost always go by <a href=#>Dora</a>, and <a href=#>Antonela</a> by <a href=#>Nela</a>.</p><p>Some of these nicknames/diminutives have become names in their own right and are used as such, like <a href=#>Tin</a> (short for <a href=#>Martin</a>, <a href=#>Valentin</a>, Augustin), Toni/Tonči/Tonći (short for Antonio), <a href=#>Nika</a> (short for Nikolina), <a href=#>Pero</a> (short for Petar). If someone told you their name was <a href=#>Nika</a> you wouldn’t assume it’s short for anything, you’d assume it’s their full name.</p><p>What you wrote about Russian diminutives and suffixes also goes for us, albeit with different suffixes! Most popular suffixes include:</p><ul><li>-ka (Anka, Ivka) - feminine</li><li>-ica (Anica (f), <a href=#>Marica</a> (f), Nikica (m), Perica (m)) - this suffix is used for nicknames of both sexes</li><li>-ša (prn. sha; Lukša, Jakša) - masculine</li><li>-ko (Joško, Paško) - masculine</li></ul><p>All of the names I listed are currently used as full names, and you are just as likely to meet a <a href=#>Josip</a> who goes by <a href=#>Joško</a> as well as someone whose full name was <a href=#>Joško</a>.</p><p>We are big on nicknames in Croatia, and if you have a shorter name (3-4 letters), which has been popular in Croatia for the past 20 years, or if your name is already a diminutive, there’s a high chance your nickname will be longer than your name! Of course, not everyone has a nickname, but it’s hard to find someone who doesn’t at least have some sort of a family nickname.</p>Possibly Confusing Nicknames (English)<p>Many people, primarily children, found it hard to say names with a “th” or “r” sound. This is how certain nicknames arose such as Molly or Polly for Mary; the “r” sound was changed to “L”, making it Molly, then using the rhyme to achieve “Polly”. This is also shown in Buffy for Elizabeth (Beth → Bethy → “th” to “f” → Buffy), and Sadie / Sally for Sara(h).</p><p>With some names, such as Charlotte, the pronunciation was altered slightly, making a nickname such as Charlie pronounced “CHAAR-lee” instead of “SHAR-lee”, from Charles.</p><p>According to Behind the Name, the word mine was commonly used in front of names by relatives. When it was said quickly, mine Anne was turned into my Nan, resulting in the older nicknames of Nan and elaborated Nancy for Ann(e) or Anna. If you are ever confused on how a name like Nell is a nickname for Eleanor, try saying the phrase “mine El” quickly! <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/forum.nameberry.com/images/emoji/apple/grinning.png title=:grinning: alt=:grinning: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Some nicknames are also borrowed from other languages; have you ever met a Margaret called Daisy? well, that all started because Margaret in French became Marguerite, the coincidental French word for daisy. So Marguerite was affectionately called Daisy, which turned into Margaret being called the same!</p>Cute Nicknames<p>Inspired to add this from the <a href=#>Cutest Celebrity Baby Names</a> post by <a class=mention href=#>@sophiekihm</a>!</p><p>Cute nicknames are used universally, as most nicknames are considered cute. However, there are some that are cuter than others— a lot of it comes from preference! There are a few different categories when it comes to nicknames; they are~</p><p><strong>Repetitive Sounds</strong></p><p>Some of the very most French-inspired nicknames are Fifi, Coco, Gigi, Kiki and company. These names all draw from the repetition of sounds featured in the names. These repetitive nicknames have given inspiration to nicknames such as Didi, Lulu, or Jojo to come from names with those prominent sounds, sounding bubbly and cutesy by the end of it.</p><p>Nicole → Coco<br>Gianna → Gigi (GG)<br>Josephine / Sofia → Fifi<br>Cecilia → Cece (CC)</p><p><strong>Pet Names</strong></p><p>Some of the cutest nicknames may be used at home only. After all, you wouldn’t put “sweetie-pie” on a school exam because that’s what your mum calls you. Examples of these names would be Sweetie, Honey, Doll, Baby, among others. <span class=spoiler>(Although Honey could make a cute name &lt;3)</span></p><p><strong>“EE” Endings</strong></p><p>The next kind would be names that are most definitely appropriate to introduce yourself as! Some of the cutest names end in the “ee” sound, and make a longer, sometimes “tougher” name sound sweet yet not too sugary. This also is used with a “zee / see” sound, such as calling your May “Maisie” or Olivia “Livsie”.</p><p>Such as…</p><p>Ellie from those names with a prominent “El” → Elizabeth, Ella, Eleanor, Eliana, et al.<br>Maisie from those “May” names like Mary and her cousins!<br>Allie from the “Al” names</p><p>And with that said, here is the most used nicknames as first names, updated as of 11/27 with data from the US 2022 Name Charts</p>The Most Used Nicknames as First Names<p>To finish this little history, I analyzed the SSA Top 100 for which “nickname names” are used the most as standalones in the US (2022).</p><p><strong>GIRLS</strong></p><p><strong>Mia</strong> still stands at the most used nickname-name for girls, with 0.62% of females born carrying this name, which originated as a nickname for Maria and is now used 0.4588% more than her parent name.</p><p><strong>Mila</strong> surpassed her spot of <span class=hashtag-raw>#26</span> from last year, coming in at <span class=hashtag-raw>#19</span> as the lilting diminutive of Camila, Milena, et al. now used on her own. Still trailing Camila, where 0.4464% of girls bore that name, Mila comes with 0.3612% of females bearing the name on its own, with a less than 0.01 difference in percentage of girls born. Mila outranks Emilia by 0.0998%, as well as Milena, which is not ranked in the top 100.</p><p><strong>Gianna</strong>, used as a nickname for Giovanna in her home country, is the name of 0.3578% of girls born in 2023, lowering in popularity from last year but still ranking high at <span class=hashtag-raw>#22</span>.</p><p><strong>Nora</strong> sometimes used as a short form of Honora, (E)leonora, and other names ending in that sound, Nora was the vintage choice of 0.3429% of parents, whereas Eleanor was the popular choice by -0.001877%, outranking Nora by 12 places.</p><p><strong>Lily</strong> rose in rank to move past Ellie with 0.3343% of baby girls named Lily, a nickname for all the “Lil” names.
