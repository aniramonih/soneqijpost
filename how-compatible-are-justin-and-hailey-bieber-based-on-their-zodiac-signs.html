Celebrity astrologer Aliza Kelly discovered during an episode of <a href=#>People's "Celebrity Astrology Investigation"</a> that Justin and Hailey have opposite moons, with Bieber being a Pisces Sun, Libra Moon, and Scorpio Rising, and Hailey a Sagittarius with an Aries Moon. Justin's natal chart indicates that he's "deeply emotional, deeply empathetic and deeply intuitive," and Hailey's moon compliments it. Their moon signs "enable the other to cultivate a deeper relationship with personal identity as well as with partnership."</p><p dir=ltr>Meanwhile, astrologist Amy Tripp told <a href=#>Refinery29</a> that Hailey's sun and Justin's north node are close to each other on the Wheel of Zodiac. "This shows an instant connection and friendship between them," she said, noting that Justin is attracted to many of Hailey's traits to the point that he's influenced by them. "She motivates and encourages him," she added. "[This combination] is considered a karmic connection, where growth is inevitable and both partners can bring out the best in each other."</p><p dir=ltr>And while they may experience marital issues, it's likely that they would find a way to work it out. Astrologer Dana DeFranco shared with <a href=#>Bustle</a> that since Justin's moon and Hailey's Venus are conjunct in Libra, there's "a lot of sweetness is present in their relationship" and that they're always going to "focus on how to make the relationship work."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhjan10gY6hprBlk6S6sa3TopmlnV2Wv6Z5ya6qraGeYq6vsIyhmKKkla56o7XEm5yrZZKWwKawjKilZqyYmrazedmom6KZk2LAqrPNrGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gwen-stefani-blake-shelton-exciting-news-during-lockdown.html><span>←</span><span>Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton announce exciting news during lockdown</span></a>
