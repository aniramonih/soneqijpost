Generally, it is spread when the bacteria enter into the bloodstream and travel to both sites. Unfortunately, it can also occur if someone suffers from a related ear, sinus or skull fracture infection, or if one undergoes a surgical procedure. Though there are several ways for this condition to develop, it still remains a serious medical concern.</p><p>Unfortunately, Jeff Beck suddenly passed away from suffering from the deadly disease. Dr. Tom Nutt, the chief executive of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Meningitis Now</a>, encourages us to be aware of the signs and symptoms of this potentially deadly illness in order to seek medical help if necessary. It is important to act fast if we begin to suspect we may be becoming ill, as early diagnosis and treatment are often the key to recovery.
