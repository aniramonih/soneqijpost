After its release, the song reached the <a href=#>number one</a> spot on the <a href=#>Billboard Hot 100</a> and stayed on the chart for 42 weeks. But what a lot of people don't know is that the process of creating "Industry Baby" is what kindled Harlow and Lil Nas X's entire working relationship.</p><p dir=ltr>Before the two met, Harlow told <a href=#>Variety</a> that they admired each other from afar. "I thought [Lil Nas X] was hilarious and I loved the way he was handling the internet," he explained. "So we just started chopping it up — we got cool, followed each other, typical digital s**t. And then after we told a few jokes and exchanged respect, he said he had a song he wanted me on and texted it over." Thus, "Industry Baby" was born!</p><p dir=ltr>Due to the homoerotic imagery in both the song and the music video, "Industry Baby" was deemed controversial by certain groups of people. When <a href=#>Teen Vogue</a> asked if this perceived controversy affected his decision to join the track, Harlow said he supported Lil Nas X no matter what. "It was a decision I made from my soul," Harlow shared. "I do think Lil Nas stands for something really important. I'm gonna be really proud as that ages."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcmtpZYJ0e8eormaikZi4brTAq6Oor12nsqK4y7Jkn52VocBurcGorK1lnJ65brrArGSxZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./horace-cooper.html><span>←</span><span>Horace Cooper Wiki, Wikipedia, Project 21, Author, Book, Bio, Age, Twitter, Birthplace</span></a>
