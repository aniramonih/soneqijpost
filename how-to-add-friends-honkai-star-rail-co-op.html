Instead, you can use their support characters temporarily. However, you can only use the support system in Calyxes and Caverns of Corrosion. Other than that, you are completely on your own.</p><p>To be able to add a support member to your team, you go to the Calyxes or Caverns of Corrosion and press the green support button that is next to your fourth team member. Once you’ve done so, this will bring up the list of support members that you can borrow from their friend list.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Then, you can select a character of your choice from the Support Character they will then join your team for the full duration of the Calyxes or Caverns of Corrosion.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s everything you need to know about adding friends in <a href=#>Honkai: Star Rail</a> and whether or not it is multiplayer co-op.
