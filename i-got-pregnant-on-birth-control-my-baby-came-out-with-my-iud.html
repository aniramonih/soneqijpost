Quick said she first knew something was awry after feeling ill for several weeks.</p><p>“I was feeling nauseous for about two weeks and I would just throw up every once in a while,” said Quick, who decided to take a pregnancy test to see what was amiss.</p><p>Her world turned upside down when it came back positive. Stunned at the improbable-seemingly bun in the oven, the TikToker took six more tests, which all yielded the same result.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">A mother is going viral after revealing that her baby emerged from her womb with her IUD in hand. “Someone has to be the 0.01 percent, and that’s me and my baby,” she said of the uncommon birth. <span class=credit>Violet Quick/Tiktok</span></figure><p>“They were all positive, and I actually went to the ER and I was seven weeks pregnant,” Quick exclaimed.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Quick had started using an IUD nine months before she got pregnant. <span class=credit>Violet Quick/Tiktok</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">If an IUD user does become pregnant, it’s usually an ectopic pregnancy, meaning the fertilized egg attaches outside the uterus. This makes the pregnancy nonviable, and is a serious threat to the person’s health. <span class=credit>Violet Quick/Instagram</span></figure><p>Her conception was particularly miraculous given that IUDs have a 99% success rate at preventing pregnancy, meaning that fewer than 1 in 100 people get pregnant while using the device, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Planned Parenthood</a>. This rate obviously increases for those whose baby blockers slip out of place — which was not the case with Quick.</p><p>Those who do get pregnant with an IUD usually have an ectopic pregnancy — in which a<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> fertilized egg implants </a>and develops outside the uterus, often on a fallopian tube, per the Mayo Clinic. If left untreated, this satellite embryo can cause life-threatening internal bleeding.</p><p>In light of her prophylactic-defying birth, Quick is warning the public to “take a test” even while using contraception.</p><p>“I would say if you are having any of those signs of pregnancy or if your period is late to take a test,” she said. “It’s better to know, because there is a high risk of having ectopic pregnancies when you have an IUD, but they work for the most part.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Quick’s case was particularly peculiar given that her IUD hadn’t slipped out of place and the device is effective 99% of the time. <span class=credit>Violet Quick/Tiktok</span></figure><p>Quick added, “Someone has to be the 0.01 percent, and that’s me and my baby.”&nbsp;</p><p>This isn’t the first time a defiant baby has slipped past the prophylactic goal line.</p><p>A Georgia baby blew <a href=#>up the interwebs in 2017</a> after coming into the world with one of the intrauterine devices clutched in his right hand.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2tmaWlfnnqou9Nmp6udl6Our8CMqKVmmpmnwal5wqilraqfoXquxYybmJuxXZiurrGMqKytZaeewal5zLJkoq2UZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-get-rid-of-grasshoppers-in-house.html><span>←</span><span>How to get rid of grasshoppers in house</span></a>
