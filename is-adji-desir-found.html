The young man, who is 13-17 years of age, is non verbal and unable to communicate what his name or address are; however locals in Midland believe he may be ‚ÄúAdji Desir‚Äù from Florida who went missing back in 2009 and has not been heard from since then. Both he and Desir share similar facial features and the non verbal trait. Even with no reports from anyone regarding this child, many people suspect it‚Äôs him due to his long absence over the past 14 years. Police are now asking for any information on the boy or his whereabouts before he appeared in Midland this past Saturday.</p><p><strong>Picture of boy recently found</strong></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112 data-inserter-version=2></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/rajasdentalcollege.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/WhatsApp-Image-2023-02-01-at-2.21.18-AM.webp><p>Midland police are investigating whether a recently found boy is Adji Desir, missing since 2009.

Brown eyes and black hair. Ji Ji is Adji‚Äôs nickname. He is of Haitian background. Adji‚Äôs clothing, complete with a blue t-shirt with thin yellow stripes, blue shorts with pink flamingos along their sides, and two-tone blue sneakers provides both a heartbreaking and emotive reminder of his random disappearance over 10 years ago.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113 data-inserter-version=2></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t80/2/16/1f91e_1f3fc.png><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Medical_Conditions></span>Medical Conditions<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>His mental disability unfortunately renders him unable to ask for help and although he can understand Haitian Creole, he cannot speak it. His only form of verbal communication is the ability to answer yes or no questions. Given his condition at the time of his disappearance, it is understandable why he has been so difficult to locate‚Äìhis very identity puts him at a distinct disadvantage and speaks to the courage that must be found within such vulnerable individuals who cannot defend themselves.</p><p>The disappearance of Adji Desir has been a heartbreaking mystery in Immokalee, Florida since January 10, 2009 when he was last seen at Farm Workers Village. His mother had left him there with his grandmother in the 800 block of Grace Street before she had to go to work that afternoon. He was playing with other children when he mysteriously disappeared around 5:15 p.m.</p><p>It had been a blissful day the one in which Adji disappeared- but it quickly turned to horror when his grandmother realized that half an hour had passed without her having seen him. Even after two hours of desperate searching, Adji was still missing and his grandmother was forced to call the police for help. As months of searching ensued, numerous areas were searched yet to no avail as there wasn‚Äôt so much as a clue as to where he could be. With Adji having lived with his mother and stepfather at the time of his disappearance, investigators looked into the possibility that he was taken to Haiti- home of some of his extended family members- but they found absolutely no evidence pointing towards that theory.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>Adji‚Äôs family aren‚Äôt suspects in his disappearance; Grandma now lives with Mom and Stepdad, who welcomed a daughter they named after him. Police think he either wandered away or was abducted by someone not related to the family. Unfortunately, his case is still unsolved.</p><p><strong>Read this also: <a href=#>Austin Coffey died: What was his cause of death?</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiqkZ%2ButLDEp6uapJOkua2xxp5lnKedZLa0ecCdoaJllJrAqr6Mn6auppRk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./285314-inside-betty-whites-carmel-house-she-bui-html.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Inside Betty Whites Carmel House She Built with Husband Allen Ludden &amp;amp; Never Wanted to Leave</span></a>
