However, he is dating actor Lukas Gage, and the relationship seems serious.&nbsp;</p><p>Lukas and Gage sparked relationship rumors in February 2023 after sharing photos of themselves together in Mexico. In March 2023, the couple made their first red-carpet appearance, seemingly confirming their relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>On 9th March 2023, Chris said people could speculate all they wanted about him and Lukas.&nbsp;“I’m a pretty open book about most things in my life, but I have a problem with the culture of everyone needing to know everybody’s business and nothing can be sacred,”&nbsp;Lukas told the outlet.&nbsp;</p><p>A week later, Appleton validated the relationship rumors. He told&nbsp;Drew Barrymore:&nbsp;“Listen, I’m very happy. Very much in love, and I feel very grateful to be able to share my time with someone very special. Love is a really special thing, and I think meeting someone you connect with is really, really special.”</p><p>Barrymore called Chris an ‘amazing human being’ and ‘the world’s great catch’. On 28th March 2023, Lukas said he was very much in love with Chris.&nbsp;“He’s a good-looking man,”&nbsp;Lukas said on TODAY.&nbsp;“Something about being in London. I got a taste of the Brits and couldn’t help myself.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=chris-appleton-has-two-kids-with-his-ex-partner-katie-katon></span>Chris Appleton has two kids with his ex-partner Katie Katon<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Before Chris came out, he dated Katie Katon. Chris and Katon started dating after meeting as teenagers. They welcomed two kids, Billy and Kitty-Blu, who are now adults.</p><p>In February 2023, Kitty-Blu shared a photo of herself and Lukas on her Instagram Stories, showing she approved of his relationship with Chris.&nbsp;</p><p>Chris told&nbsp;Gay Times&nbsp;that he consulted Billy and Kitty-Blu before coming out publicly as gay. He stated:</p><p>“Everybody has got their stories and some people are ready with it straight away, I just wasn’t. I didn’t have that realization. It was also really important to me that the kids were comfortable before I expressed that, and that they understood and were in a good place. It was later on.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKGjYrCpvsisZJqooKGytbvNZqSaqqKesqV5wKWjZrGfqnqvscSdZK2nXaC7sMOO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-catherine-mcbroom-pregnant-again-in-2022-find-her-baby-bump-pictures-on-snapchat-227954-html.html><span>←</span><span>Is Catherine Mcbroom Pregnant Again In 2022?
