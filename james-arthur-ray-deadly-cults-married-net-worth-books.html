When the victims get humiliated and do not get the required justice as per the abuse or crime, he dealt against, that we call an injustice. Well, in the case of a motivational speaker James Ray, outrage has been on the note of his sentence to prison.</span></p><p><span>The actual case is that the motivational speaker's cult ceremony killed three people, and he only got sentenced to two years in prison. And you can presume that it is a new form of injustice made to the criminals. And still, it is working.</span></p><p><span>Take a look at James Ray and his cult ceremony below!!</span></p><h2><span><strong>Oxygen's 'Deadly Cults' Shows James Arthur Ray Cult Ceremony</strong></span></h2><p><span>Oxygen has come with a documentary named 'Deadly Cults,' which plays the story on how James Arthur Ray's Spiritual Warrior retreat cost the lives of three people back in 2009 and left more than 18 people injured. The second season of the documentary premiered on the 26th of April 2020.</span></p><p><span>The cult ceremony named Spiritual Warrior came&nbsp;into the keen attention and inspection of the public back in 2009, started by the self-help guru James Ray. Maybe the tradition was thought to be taken wisely and carefully; however, it went completely wrong in the town of Sedona, Arizona, which killed three people in action.</span></p><p><span>There were several stages in the Spiritual Warrior, among which the&nbsp;Sweat Lodge was the final one. James Ray called the phase 'a journey of power,' which was more intense and challenging than the previous ones.</span></p><p><span>Participants who competed paid&nbsp;$10,000 with no cash refund policy.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>As described, The Sweat Lodge was hot, filled with&nbsp;rocks in the center, a kind like life-threatening one. However, James' policy had altered the participants to compete. During the five-day-retreat, the competitors were made to endure fasting, mind-altering breathing exercises, and sleep deprivation.</span></p><p><span>However, the result of Spiritual Warriors came negative, costing three people's Life. The three victims were Kirby Brown from Westtown, New York, James Shore from Milwaukee, and Liz Neuman from Prior Lake, Minnesota.</span></p><p><span><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbiz.com/images/Celebrities/james-arthur-ray.jpg alt width=650 height=433 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span></p><p><span>James Ray spent two years in prison (©: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Oxygen</a>)</span></p><p><span>Eighteen other people were injured due to&nbsp;burns and dehydration, kidney failure, breathing problems, and heat exhaustion and eventually hospitalized.</span></p><p><span>As a result, James Ray&nbsp;got convicted and sentenced a couple of years in prison in 2011, citing a negligent homicide.

He mentioned that his marriage was 'out of guilt and shame' as he had just had sex for the very first time for which he got convinced James would be dumped if he did not legalize his dastardly deed.</span></p><p><span>Nevertheless, his marriage did not work, and his wife filed a divorce after two years of togetherness. During the time, the banks had just begun foreclosure proceedings against him and his wife.</span></p><p><span>James Ray and his wife finalized their divorce in February 1987, after four years of their wedding.&nbsp;</span><span>Apart from that, James' wife identity remains&nbsp;a mystery.</span></p><h2><span><strong>James Ray's Net Worth And His Books</strong></span></h2><p><span>James Arthur Ray has an estimated<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> net worth</a> of $2.4 million, which he accumulated from his self-help career as well as his tv appearances on Oprah, Larry King, and the movie 'The Secret.'</span></p><p><span>James Ray is also an author with several famous books on his career rack.
