But much like little Nicholas Hoult, Jamie has grown up to be quite attractive in that particular way English boys are sexy/naughty. Jamie is currently hittin’ it with Evan Rachel Wood, which… sounds hot to me. I like Evan, and after this new interview with Jamie in GQ UK, I really like Jamie too. <a href=#>You can read the full cunnilingus-y awesomeness here</a>, and here are some highlights:</p><p><strong>GQ.com: What’s small talk with Steven Spielberg like?</strong><br><strong>Jamie Bell:</strong> I was so nervous to reveal how much of a fanboy I am in case he started thinking, “Oh my God, we’ve cast a maniac.” So it’s only been recently, hanging out with Steven and doing all the press that I’ve been able to go, “Dude, that decision in Hook when he does this thing…” But I held my tongue for the longest time.</p><p><strong>What’s the strangest gift you’ve ever got from a fan?</strong><br>I’ve got lots of weird illustrations of me from Japanese fans. I also got a dead moth. [Pause] Which actually might be more of a threat than a present.</p><p><strong>Having screen-tested for Spider-man, what superhero role would you like to have a crack at next?</strong><br>Considering I failed at the first one, I don’t know. I’ve never felt particularly connected to Peter Parker, [so] I felt like they made the right decision. I actually can’t wait to see the movie – I think it’s going to be great. My favourite superhero is obviously Batman because he’s the sexiest. But I can’t imagine myself as Batman…</p><p><strong>What’s the best way to impress a woman?</strong><br>Buy her flowers? Take her home on the weekend to meet your mother? No. Let’s cut to the primal – be good in the sack. [Slaps thighs] Have an understanding of what’s going on down there and have fun, awesome sex.</p><p><strong>What’s the question you hate being asked?</strong><br>If I hear “What was it like working with Steven Spielberg?” one more time, I might jump out of that window. “Do you miss England?” is really annoying. The third one is “How did you avoid the pitfalls of being a child actor?” I don’t even know what that means. Do child stars hit pitfalls? That’s such a stereotypical thing to say. I know lot of actors who have started off as kids and I feel it’s really unfair.</p><p><strong>What should no man have in his wardrobe?</strong><br>Crocs. It’s just not on.</p><p><strong>What film do you consider particularly stylish?</strong><br>Definitely Drive. Even just the promotion and marketing on that movie is awesome. [Mimics the pitch] “It’s a cool stunt-guy action movie and let’s make the font look like Dirty Dancing.” You’re going to get women through the door. Well, I mean, you’re going to get women through the door anyway with Gosling…</p><p><strong>What’s the best piece of advice you’ve ever received?</strong><br>What’s the best penis I’ve ever seen?</p><p><strong>No! Actually, what is the best penis you’ve ever seen?</strong><br>[Collapses into laughter] That is a good question. The best piece of advice I ever received was “Don’t f*** your publicist.” Russell Crowe told me that. It’s probably a smart move. [Both of his publicists are now in the room, attempting to bring the interview to a close] No! It’s GQ!</p><p><strong>What skill should every man have?</strong><br>Skill? You know what I’m going to say. A man should have a good understanding of a vagina. He should be good at oral sex. On a woman.</p><p><strong>You do realise you’ve got another publicist standing right behind you?</strong><br>I don’t care. A skill a man should have? Making fires and pleasing a woman. In the vaginal area.</p><p>[From <a href=#>GQ</a>]</p><p>I like to think that his sexy answers are the result of him dating an American girl who is demanding in bed (side-eye at Evan). I like to think that these are HER words, her philosophy, and that Jamie is just a lovely young man, eager to learn how to please a woman. In the vaginal area. Evan is certainly living the dream, isn’t she?</p><p>Oh, and did anyone else cut there eyes at “A man should have a good understanding of a vagina. He should be good at oral sex. On a woman.” There are several things wrong with that, I think. First, it shouldn’t be “A” case-specific vagina, it should be “A man should have a good understanding of ALL VAGINAS.” It should be the general, or “royal” vadge. Our collective flock of vaginas. Secondly, he has to specify “ON A WOMAN.” Oh, Jamie. Marry me.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/wenn3422334.jpg alt=wenn3422334 title=wenn3422334 width=560 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/wenn3239528.jpg alt=wenn3239528 title=wenn3239528 width=560 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/wenn3441470.jpg alt=wenn3441470 title=wenn3441470 width=560 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of WENN.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmanBnaIB3e8mapKKdj5eyrbi%2BmpammZ6UwKm71KWbmKCRq7Kgrb6gpqicj6q7pbHRrKuappSeu6irzp%2BWmpemlrSqusBo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./james-wan-height.html><span>←</span><span>James Wan Height, Net Worth, Wife, Age, Family</span></a>
