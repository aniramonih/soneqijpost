<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Jane Lynch Talks Glee's Series Finale: Singing My Last Song Was Brutal</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Sue Sylvester is signing off.<strong> <a href=#>Jane Lynch</a> </strong>— like the rest of the Glee cast — has had a tough time saying goodbye to McKinley High School. The Emmy-winning actress opened up to <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a> </strong>about wrapping the TV comedy’s sixth and final season, and more while attending the Febreze and the ASPCA Present #Noseblind event in NYC on Wednesday, Feb. 25.</p><p>Lynch has appeared on the Fox series since its pilot in 2009. Her character has gone from enemies to friends with Will Schuester (<a href=#><strong>Matthew Morrison</strong></a>), led the Cheerios cheerleading squad, and has even paid homage to Madonna’s iconic “Vogue” video. But despite the songs and fond memories, Lynch admits that the last couple of episodes have been painfully bittersweet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“This last season they’ve really pulled out all the stops. I love it,” Lynch, 54, told <strong>Us</strong>. “The stuff with <strong>Dot-Marie Jones</strong> — the transgender character, everything she went through. I think they’re going to be very impactful. I think they worked for the audience and shooting them was a real delight.”</p><p>This season, Jones’ Coach Shannon Beiste was given <a href=#>a new transgender story line.</a> In the episode “Jagged Little Tapestry” last month, her character emotionally reveals that she will be transitioning from a woman to a man to Sue and Sam Evans (<a href=#><strong>Chord Overstreet</strong></a>).</p><p>“[The show has] been mind-blowing for forward-thinking. It’s nice to not get up on a soap box, [but] to do it through the show,” Lynch continued. “It’s good to have really hated characters that you love at the end and characters that are so good you want to spank them! Matt Morrison’s character is like that, he’s so lovely and he’s just like that in real life.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Lynch and the rest of the cast and crew celebrated the end of the beloved show <a href=#>with two wrap parties:</a> a carnival on set on Feb. 21 and a bash at an L.A. Nightclub on Feb. 24. But before riding a Ferris wheel and dancing, the actors had a tough time leaving their characters behind.</p><p>“It’s been really sad, it’s all over now,” the After the Reality actress told <strong>Us</strong>. “I wasn’t expecting it to be what it was, it felt very right that it was over and we really celebrated it. We celebrated every cast member one at a time.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>As previously reported,<strong> <a href=#>Cory Monteith</a></strong> was also remembered by the longtime friends at the get-togethers. The Canadian actor, who dated his onscreen girlfriend <a href=#><strong>Lea Michele</strong></a> in real life, died tragically from a heroin and alcohol <a href=#>overdose at 31 in July 2013.</a> The handsome actor played Finn Hudson, the lovable football player and New Directioners leader, on the series.</p><p>“We all remember Cory everyday, one of the best guys I’ve known,” Lynch said. “We all still remember and love him everyday. I love the whole cast and I’ll see them in life, but when the show ends you won’t see them like you used to. Everyone is going to go on with their lives.” She added: “I’ll miss it.”</p><p>As for what last song fans can expect to hear Lynch sing before the credits roll one last time? An ABBA song with Morrison. She admitted: “That was brutal.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKGappViubq6wqFkrZmcoMBus8uenKxlo5q%2FqrHSZp2ippGhsm6%2FyKeeoqaXYrq6ecuaqq1lo6S7qHnWmqpmmqKqwaK4jGtnam1ibH8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jake-stevens.html><span>←</span><span>Jake Stevens</span></a>
