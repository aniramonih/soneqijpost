At age 7, Jesse received his first mini-bike, and as a high school freshman, he made a motorcycle exhaust system in his mother’s garage. James attended La Sierra High School and the University of California in Riverside, where he was outside linebacker on the school’s football team until a knee injury dashed his athletic hopes. When Jesse was 19, he became a bouncer and worked as a bodyguard to bands such as Slayer, Soundgarden, and Danzig. After he was injured at a concert, James decided to pursue a career he was truly passionate about: creating custom motorcycles.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Person Name:</th><td>Jesse James</td></tr><tr><th>Net Worth:</th><td>$50 million</td></tr><tr><th>Date of Birth:</th><td>April 19, 1969</td></tr><tr><th>Place of Birth:</th><td>Long Beach, California</td></tr><tr><th>Gender:</th><td>Male</td></tr><tr><th>Profession:</th><td>Custom Motorcycle Builder, Gun-maker, TV Personality</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Jesse James has competed in and won several off-road races and long-distance desert races, as well as appearing in multiple video games, including programmer RAGE Software’s outstanding platform game.

From his early days as a co-owner of the Austin Speed Shop to his current position as President of Jesse James Firearms Unlimited, James has built an impressive career for himself with his unique creations and captivating personality.</p><p>But it wasn’t just James’ skills as a builder that propelled him to celebrity status. Over the years, he has also made a name for himself on various television programs and reality shows. One of his earliest ventures into TV was Monster Garage, which followed James and his team as they built custom motorcycles. He later went on to host other shows like Jesse James Is a Dead Man and Outlaw Garage, among others.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/mediacoverage.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Jesse-James-net-worth.jpg alt width=1300 height=867 sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Despite his success in these areas, many wonder about the personal life of the modern-day Jesse James. And there is one question that seems to come up time and time again: is he related to the infamous outlaw Jesse Woodson James?</p><p>According to James’ website, his great-great-grandfather was a cousin to the legendary outlaw. But some historians argue that those claims have yet to be properly verified. The only way to confirm these ancestral links would be through DNA testing—a possibility that remains open but unfulfilled.</p><p>Regardless of whether or not he’s related to his namesake, however, there is no denying that the modern-day Jesse James has carved out an impressive legacy all his own. From iconic custom bikes and guns worth tens of thousands of dollars apiece to a string of successful TV appearances, he has proven himself time and again as one of America’s most fascinating builders and entertainers.</p><p>With all that said, what will the future hold for this larger-than-life figure?
