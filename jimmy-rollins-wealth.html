Throughout his career, which started in 2000, Rollins achieved several milestones, including being voted the MVP of the National League in 2007. He also earned three invitations to the All-Star game, won the Golden Glove for the Best Defensive player at the shortstop position four times, and clinched the Silver Stick award for the Best Offensive player at his position. Furthermore, Rollins contributed to Philadelphia Phillies’ victory in the 2008 World Series and received the Roberto Clemente Award in 2014.</p><p>It’s estimated that Jimmy Rollins’ net worth amounts to a staggering $40 million, primarily accumulated through his successful baseball career.</p><p>During his tenure with the Philadelphia Phillies from 2000 to 2014, Rollins made significant contributions. For instance, in his debut full season in 2001, he garnered 180 hits with a batting average of .274 and 46 stolen bases. His remarkable achievements led to various accolades, such as finishing 17th in the voting for the Best Player and securing the 3rd position in the Rookie of the Year voting, with the title being won by Albert Pujols. Additionally, Rollins achieved a franchise record by rotating through 38 consecutive matches with at least one hit, the best overall by a Philadelphia Phillies player since the team’s inception in 1883. He also secured the Gold Glove award for the best defensive shortstop in the National League in 2007, 2008, and 2009, and the Silver Stick award for the Best Offensive shortstop in 2007.</p><p>Despite many achievements, Rollins faced challenges in his career. For instance, in 2007, he was not elected to the All-Star team, despite becoming the fourth player to accumulate at least 20 doubles, triples, circuits, and stolen bases. Remarkably, he was the first player in MLB history to achieve 200 hits, 20 triples, 30 home runs, and 30 stolen bases in a single season. Later, in 2014, Rollins set a record by making his 2,235th hit for the Phillies, breaking the franchise record set by the legendary Mike Schmidt. Subsequently, he was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers at the end of 2014.</p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmihoqWdrnqzu8uloKerXayyorjToWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jess-glynne-mnek-ascap-vanguard-award.html><span>←</span><span>Jess Glynne and MNEK to receive ASCAP Vanguard Award</span></a>
