As a word-play, he named the game ‘Wordle.’ The couple played for months and the game became a compulsion in his family’s WhatsApp group after he introduced the game to his relatives.</p><p>In October 2021, after realizing that he might be onto something, Josh released the game to the world. In November 2021, the game which went public was played by 90 people. Two months after, over $300 thousand people played the game.</p><p>Talking about the game. it invites players to guess a five-letter word similarly to the guess-the-color game Mastermind. Then the game instructs you whether any of your letters were in the secret word and whether they were in the correct place. A player gets six tries to get it right.</p><p>The best thing about the game is, there are no popping ads or flashing banners.</p><p>Josh had also previously crated two collaborative social experiments on the site, called The Button (2015) and Place (2017).</p><p>As for the backstory, Wordle’s prototype was created in 2013. He presented the idea to his friends and was discarded. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, he and Palak delved into the New York Times Spelling Bee and the daily crossword.

She helped sort the nearly 12000 obscure five-letter words which would’ve been near impossible to guess.</p><p>The words then narrowed down to 2500, which should last for a year. Palak shared that she wakes up with a new routine that warms up with the Spelling Bee which gets her mind right for the Wordle. Although her partner Josh created the ‘Wordle’ in public she is happy that he created the game for her.</p><p>“It’s really sweet,” Palak told New York Times. “This is definitely how Josh shows his love.”</p><p>Not much detail has been shared about their relationship.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Josh Wardle Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Josh Wardle should have a net worth of $800 thousand.</p><p>Josh started his career as a technical assistant at Century Films Ltd where he worked for a year from 2007-2008.
