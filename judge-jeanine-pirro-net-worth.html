She is known for serving as a Chairwoman of the New York State Commission on Domestic Violence Fatalities since 1997. Since 2011, she has been starring in the reality TV legal show “Justice with Judge Jeanine” aired on the Fox News Channel.</p><p>How much is the net worth of Jeanine Pirro? It has been estimated by authoritative sources that the total size of her wealth is as much as $5 million, as of the data presented in the middle of 2017, earned during a career in law which began in the 1970s.</p><h3>Judge Jeanine Pirro Net Worth $5 Million</h3><p>To begin with, Jeanine was raised in Elmira by her parents Esther and Nasser Pirro, and was educated at Notre Dame High School, and afterwards graduated with a Bachelor’s degree from the University of Buffalo, as well as a Juris Doctor degree from Albany Law School in 1975.</p><p>Concerning her legal career, she was appointed as Westchester County Assistant District Attorney in 1975, and became note particularly for establishing one of the first Domestic Violence Units in the US. Among other firsts, she was elected a Westchester County judge in 1990, and then the first female to be elected District Attorney of the County in 1993, subsequently being re-elected several times until her announcement that she would not be seeking re-election in 2005.</p><p>In addition, Pirro landed a career in politics – in 1997 starting to worki in the position of the New York State Commission on Domestic Violence Fatalities. In 2006, Jeanine&nbsp; participated in the elections for the position of Senator of New York, but was defeated by <a href=#>Hillary Clinton</a>.</p><p>Furthermore, Jeanine Pirro has made a career on television too. She is known for contributing to the syndicated Fox channel “The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet” (2007 – 2009), and as a legal analyst, she is contributing to many more programs, including “Good Day New York”, “Today” and “Fox News”. As a guest star, Pirro has been invited to host “Geraldo at Large”, “The <a href=#>Joy Behar</a> Show”, “<a href=#>Larry King</a> Live” and other shows, as well as from 2008 to 2011 starring in the arbitration-based reality court show “Judge Jeanine Pirro”, which in 2011 won Jeanine the Daytime Emmy Award for the Outstanding Legal/Courtroom Program. However, the same year the show was cancelled as a result of low audience ratings, but in the same year, another reality legal show “Justice with Judge Jeanine” (2011 – present) was started, in which Pirro presents legal insights to the most important news of the week. All these commitments have add consistently to her net worth.</p><p>Jeanine is also an author, having released several books, including “To Punish and Protect” (2003) in which she described life in the criminal justice system. She is also co-author of the novel “Sly Fox” (2012) which is also based on facts from her own life.</p><p>To conclude, all the above mentioned engagements have added sums to the&nbsp; size of Jeanine Pirro’s net worth, and popularity.</p><p>Finally, in the personal life of Jeanine Pirro, she married Albert Pirro in 1975, and they have two children. Her husband was declared guilty of federal tax evasion and jailed in 2000, which could have harmed the career of Jeanine. In 2007 the two announced their separation, apparently because of Albert’s alleged adultery, but their divorce wasn’t finalized in 2013. Regardless, Jeanine continues with her popular TV career.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=22.387012987013><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Jeanine Pirro</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>June 2, 1951</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Elmira, New York, USA</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Profession</td><td>Former Republican Official, Legal analyst, Television personality, TV show host</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Education</td><td>Albany Law School, Notre Dame High School, University at Buffalo</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Albert Pirro (m. 1975–2013)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td>Christi Pirro, Alexander Pirro</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Nasser Ferris, Esther Ferris</td></tr><tr readability=0.32><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/judgejeaninepirro</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.35897435897436><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/judgejeanine</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.36734693877551><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/judge_jeanine/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm1984860</a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Awards</td><td>Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Legal/Courtroom Program (2011)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Nominations</td><td>Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series Directing Team, Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series Directing Team</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Movies</td><td>“Geraldo at Large”, “The Joy Behar Show”, “Larry King Live”</td></tr><tr readability=16><td>TV Shows</td><td>"Judge Jeanine Pirro" (2008-2011), "The Jinx", "Justice with Judge Jeanine" (2011-), “Geraldo at Large”, “The Joy Behar Show”, “Larry King Live”, "The Tyra Banks Show", “The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet” (2007 – 2009), “Good Day New York”, “Today”, “Fox News”, “G...</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=15.81064690027><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>One of her first jobs was a telephone operator.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Has a sister named Lulu.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>3</td><td>Release of her book, "To Punish and Protect: A DA's Fight Against a System That Coddles Criminals" by Jeanine with Catherine Whitney.
