On Saturday, March 14, the Biebs taped his highly anticipated Comedy Central Roast where no topic was off-limits, especially his on-again, off-again romance with “The Heart Wants What It Wants” singer, 22.&nbsp;</p><p>“Selena Gomez wanted to be here, but she’s dating men now,” comedian<strong> Jeff Ross</strong> joked. “Is it true you dumped her because she grew a mustache before you?”</p><p>And that wasn’t even the most controversial comment from Ross, who also called Bieber, 21, “the King Joffrey of Pop.”</p><p>“Selena Gomez had sex with [you]… proving Mexicans will do the disgusting jobs Americans just won’t do,” Ross added.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>But not all comments were directed at Gomez. Naturally, the “Boyfriend” singer got the brunt of the attack.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Justin, as a father of six you have to straighten up, son. Last year, you were ranked the fifth most hated person of all time,” former basketball star <strong>Shaquille O’Neal </strong>said. “Kim Jong-un didn’t rank that low. And he uses your music to torture people.”</p><p>Ultimately, Bieber got in the last laugh, saying, “What do you get when you give a teenager $200 million? A bunch of has-beens calling you a lesbian for two hours.”</p><p>Justin Bieber’s Comedy Central Roast will air Monday, March 30 at 10 p.m. ET.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKGuq6Seu26uyJ6Znqpdp7yiv9NmmqillZm2orrSZqSom5tiwKa4xKeYZp%2BforK7eZFpaG5pZWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./job-dockery-age-brother-how-old-is-he-2.html><span>←</span><span>Job Dockery Age Brother: How Old Is He?</span></a>
