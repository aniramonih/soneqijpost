Ergo, nobody knew the November stint would be his last appearance.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>That was so because his&nbsp;character and voiceovers were extant on the series until the end of 2019.&nbsp;But in January 2020, Chambers startled everyone with an official announcement of his exit. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>"There's no good time to say goodbye to a show and character that's defined so much of my life for the past 15 years,"&nbsp;he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">told Deadline</a>&nbsp;through a statement.

"For 16 seasons, 16 years, we have grown up alongside Alex&nbsp;Karev," she added.</p><p>Vernoff admitted that the show will always miss Chambers and shared that they will always be grateful for his&nbsp;impact on the series and the world. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>What Is Justin Chambers Doing Now?</h2><p>A year and a half after his exit from Grey's Anatomy, Chambers landed an iconic role of Marlon Brando in Paramount+'s upcoming limited series,&nbsp;The Offer.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In July 2021, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Deadline reported</a> that the project would be based on the famed producer Al Ruddy's experience creating the 1972 classic movie <a href=# rel=follow>The Godfather</a>.
