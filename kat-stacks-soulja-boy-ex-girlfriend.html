<span>Tandra Barner</span></p><h1>Who is Kat Stacks [Soulja Boy rumored ex-girlfriend]?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>In 2010, Kat Stacks shook the world of Hip hop. One after the other, Kat went after popular American rappers exposing their dirty laundry. The videos caught fire on YouTube and Kate was in the midst of a long-stretched battle against some of the popular names in the hip-hop industry. From Nelly to Bow Wow to the lesser-known Cash Money crew, no one was safe from Kat. However, it was later revealed that Kat was the victim of a series of abuse. In this article, we take a closer look at the life of Kat Stacks.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Early Life</h2><p>Andrea Herrera A.K.A Kat Stacks was born on the 2nd of November 1989, in Caracas, Venezuela. Born and raised in Caracas, Kate stayed in the country and moved to the States when she was 8 years of age. Kat and her mother stayed in Northern Miami and Kat spent the most miserable times of her life at North Miami. As a young kid, Kat stayed with her mother, grandmother, and two uncles. However, Kat’s mother was seldom home and she spent much of her early life staying with her grandmother. Her grandmother had mental issues and pushed Kat out of the house.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Kat-Stacks.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A Stairway to Hell</h2><p>At the age of 14, Kate was first introduced to the world of pimps. For the first time, Kat realized that the pimp game was nothing like the one portrayed in pop culture. In an interview, Kat revealed that she was involved in pimping from a young age and the man was in her mind. She struggled to set free, only to realize that she was beyond her mind.</p><p>“I think nobody could have helped me back then. My mind was so gone. And I was with a gorilla track pimp and those are the worst. I was always just alone in my mind.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Getting Out</h2><p>It took an arrest for Kate to finally get out of being a pimp. As Kat and her mother had exceeded their temporary VISA arrangements, she lived under the constant threat of being deported. She was arrested at the age of 19, but things worked in her favor.</p><p>“I had a firearm. And they tried to deport me, but they released me because I was pregnant. So they said the only way they wouldn’t deport me and I could be released was if I stayed with my family with an ankle bracelet. He couldn’t come close to me. And then having my family’s support and their love, and I had had [his] baby, it was just a different experience from what I was used to. “</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dishing on Rappers:</h2><p>While she was placed under house arrest, Kat was approached by the head of the website WorldStarHipHop, to work on a series of videos dishing out on rappers. Kat agreed and released a set of videos that became viral around the world. While Kat later revealed that the videos were for entertainment, they did come to haunt her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Soulja-Boy-ex-girlfriend-Kat-Stacks.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Problems with the Law</h2><p>Even after she was placed on house arrest, Kat was under constant threat of being deported. As both Kat and her mother had not been naturalized by 2010, it left her open to deportation. After missing an important court date, Kat was arrested while attempting to leave Nashville, Tennessee on November 5, 2010. She ended up staying 3-years in immigration jail. She was granted amnesty after being identified as a victim of sex trafficking.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Life After</h2><p>Since her release, Kat has worked to help girls in similar positions. She released the book Admire Andrea: Surviving Savagery to Saving Lives. Kat also worked to establish a foundation to help young girls in her situation. As she puts it,</p><p>“I feel like Andrea was that scared little girl when all that crap happened and Kat Stacks was a survivor, and there are many other upcoming Kat Stacks running around, and I feel like I’m proud of it. I can use my experiences to help others that are in the same situation I was in.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Personal life: Father of her son?</h2><p>At the age of 19, Kat became the mother of the first child, a son named TJ. The name of the father is yet to be identified in the media house. But rumors keep circulating such as the baby’s father is the man&nbsp;who brought her into the world of prostitution. As of now, Kat is officially single. When talking about her other relationship&nbsp; Kat claims to have dated famous rappers such as Lil Wayne, Yung Maserati, and Soulja Boy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwprjEm6qippake6S7zGiimqxdqMGir8qsZKynpaG3onnBqLBmnahitKq%2By5%2Bpop2emXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./news-fedor-emelianenko-brother-who-go-prison.html><span>←</span><span>Who is he and why did he go to prison?</span></a>
