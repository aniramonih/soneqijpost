The Duchess of Cambridge just gave birth to Princess Charlotte less than six months ago, but she has <a rel=nofollow href=#>already lost her pregnancy weight</a> – and then some. Basically, the only time Kate Middleton doesn’t look like skin and bones is when she has been pregnant with George and Charlotte.</p><p>This week’s edition of National Enquirer features some new photos of Kate Middleton looking painfully skinny. One of National Enquirer’s Royal Family insiders dished to the tabloid, “It’s horrifying. She looks like she has lost 20 pounds in the last few months. Her arms appear to be skin and bones.” The Enquirer goes on to report that Kate actually lost weight while she was pregnant with Charlotte and allegedly collapsed at one point during her pregnancy – causing her husband Prince William to put her under 24 hour medical supervision.</p><p>Kate Middleton has never been a big woman, and she did drop her baby weight rather fast after she gave birth to Princess Charlotte. We would be more apt to believe that Kate Middleton is more stressed than she is anorexic. On top of the fact that she has two children under the age of 3 years old to care for, she has the stresses of her Royal duties – and she is living her entire life under a microscope. If Kate Middleton wasn’t losing weight too fast, then the tabloids would say that she was either <a rel=nofollow href=#>obese or pregnant again – she can’t win</a>.</p><p>What do you guys think, is there any truth to the rumors that Kate Middleton is battling anorexia and starving herself to death slowly? Or are you more apt to believe that she is stressed to the max and too busy caring for her babies and smiling for the press to have time to eat a healthy meal?
