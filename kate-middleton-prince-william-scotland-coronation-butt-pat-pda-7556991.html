The suite includes the crown of King James V of Scotland, a scepter, and a new sword of state. The day also included a 21-gun salute from Edinburgh Castle and a Royal Procession that traveled from the church to the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the Charles's official residence in Scotland. After that, the Red Arrows of the Royal Air Force arrived overheard for a dramatic fly-past.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Scotland will welcome the new King and Queen in July with a series of events to mark the Coronation. A People’s Procession, a Royal Procession, a National Service of Thanksgiving and a Gun Salute will take place in Edinburgh," First Minister Humza Yousaf said in a statement released after the May 6 coronation in England. "Representatives from many different communities and organizations in Scotland will take part in these historic events. People who wish to mark this historic occasion can get involved by watching broadcast coverage or viewing events in person."<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57ypqrnmWdnrGluMStpqdloKe2r6%2FEZq6ipJyerq550pymraSRo7Fur86rpqeZpJ68r3nBrqutZaCWwW68w5pkcG1la4Z6fQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./7329-jon-sandman-html.html><span>←</span><span>Jon Sandman</span></a>
