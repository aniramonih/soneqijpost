She successfully posed for photos before the show, complete with an oversized fork (or as Ariel would call it, a dinglehopper).</p><p>While sitting on the judges’ panel, however, things took a turn. As host <a href=#><strong>Ryan Seacrest</strong></a> was introducing the plan for the episode, a crash was heard off-camera followed by <a href=#><strong>Luke Bryan</strong></a>‘s hysterical laughter. Perry, who’d been propping her fins up on the desk, had <a href=#>fallen out of her chair backwards</a> head first.</p><p>After the country star, 45, and <a href=#><strong>Lionel Richie</strong></a> confirmed that the “Wide Awake” songstress was OK, they stood her back up with help from Seacrest, 47. The audience then chanted, “Katy! Katy” as she sat down and took a sip of her drink.</p><p>“Hell with mermaids!” Bryan exclaimed while looking directly into the camera. “I love it,” Richie, 72, added. “I love it!”</p><p>Perry shared several photos of the outfit via Instagram after the show, referencing Ariel’s famous song “Part of Your World” in one of her captions. “Look at this #americanidol episode, isn’t it neat?” she quipped alongside a photo of herself posing with her dinglehopper.</p><p>In a behind-the-scenes video, the Grammy nominee had to lie down on the floor while her team helped her into the form-fitting mermaid tail. “Some BTS of a lil Sunday sushi,” the pop star wrote in her caption. Her dog Nugget sat patiently off to the side, wearing a Flounder costume.</p><p>The California native also shared a clip that showed <a href=#>Bryan and Richie rolling her on stage</a> using a dolly. “I’ve never seen a human this close,” she joked in another video where she was standing between her fellow judges.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Perry later shared a clip of the fall, writing, “Flippin’ your fins you don’t get too far 🧜🏻‍♀️😅 swipe to see what almost accidentally killed @lionelrichie.” The “Hello” crooner also reposted the incident on his own Instagram Story, writing, “I wasn’t ready for this … everything was OK and then it got crazy.”</p><p>Keep scrolling for more photos of Perry’s big tumble.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BgrrXFjKmcq6qpYrOiuMusZKitpGK8p3nCoZiiql2WwG6t0aKcpWWfo3qiucSroJyZnmK2pbvLZq2inJWkfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./joe-manganiello.html><span>←</span><span>Joe Manganiello News - Us Weekly</span></a>
