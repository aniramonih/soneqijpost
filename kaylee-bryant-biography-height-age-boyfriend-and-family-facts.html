brother.&nbsp;She was welcomed into her family on the first day of November 1997, when her mother gave birth to her in Malibu, California.&nbsp;Although she is popularly known as Kaylee Bryant, her birth name is actually Kaylee Kaneshiro.&nbsp;The actress has an American nationality due to her birth in the United States but her ethnic origin is not known.</span></p><p><span>As an individual, much is still not known about Kaylee’s educational accomplishments.&nbsp;However, the Malibu native reportedly completed her basic levels of learning in the United States, even though the names of the institutions she attended are not pictured.</span></p><p><span>Bryant started paddling his own canoe in the industry when he was eight years old.&nbsp;So far, she has featured and also starred in an impressive number of projects.&nbsp;Some of her professional credits include&nbsp;</span><span>Santa Clarita

same can’t be said for her family members.&nbsp;She has a great relationship with her father Garrett Kaneshiro, mother Kristina Kaneshiro, and older brother Kane Kaneshiro.&nbsp;The trio have been very supportive of the actress’ career from day one and Kaylee has never made headlines for having a relationship full of tension or falling out with any of them, even though her family has had its fair share of ups and downs.</span></p><p><span>Information regarding the personal lives of Garrett, Kristina and Kane is still a mystery and cannot be reviewed by the public at this
