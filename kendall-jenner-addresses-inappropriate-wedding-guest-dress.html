I’m embarrassed for you. #cringe,” one user wrote. A few fans came to the model’s defense, with one user writing, “If the bride herself doesn’t gaf why do you care? relax.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Perez then got in on the action. “Tell em,” she wrote. “SHE LOOKED STUNNING AND I LOVED IT!”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp; </span>And once the bride clapped back at the haters (in the nicest way possible), the Keeping Up With the Kardashians alum entered the chat. “@laurenperez obvi asked for your approval in advance too. We love a beach wedding,” she wrote.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Kendall-Jenner-Addresses-Her-Inappropriate-Wedding-Guest-Dress.jpg><p class=p1>Jenner didn’t only wear a skin-baring gown to the festivities. The Tequila 818 founder wore something a bit more traditional for the ceremony. For her bridesmaids duties the day of, Jenner wore a teal blue silk shift dress.</p><p class=p1>That in mind, the controversies about her wedding attire didn’t start and stop at Perez’s wedding. The same weekend, the Moon ambassador was a guest at friend <strong>Simon Huck</strong> and <strong>Phil Riportella</strong>’s nuptials.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>And after <a href=#><strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong></a> shared an image of everyone’s outfits, fans came after Jenner once again. In the photo, Khloe, <a href=#><strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong></a>, <strong>Stephanie Shepard</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Malika Haqq</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Hailey Baldwin</strong></a> are all in black.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span>Jenner, on the other hand, wore a gold gown with a thigh-high slit and plunging neckline that many claimed had her oozing “main character energy.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“Everyone fire, but Kendall didn’t get the assignment,” a user wrote, while another questioned, “Did Kendall miss the black memo?” Someone else added: “Kendall is serving Scorpio vibes.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Given that the reality star has a habit of arriving in show-stopping attire to other people’s big days, it should be interesting to she what she wears when the 42-year-old Poosh founder and <a href=#><strong>Travis Barker</strong></a> tie the knot. The pair got engaged in October 2021 on the beach, where the drummer set up an elaborate display of roses.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6Cyr7DApaNmopWju6a%2BjJqbnaqVqMCmv4yipZqooKe8sb7ImqueZaeasaW1zaBkoK2VqMFusNGeqqxn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jillian-barberie-net-worth-2020-2021.html><span>←</span><span>Jillian Barberie Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Kids, Bio-Wiki</span></a>
