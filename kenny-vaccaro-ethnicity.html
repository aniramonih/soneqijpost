Despite leaving behind his football aspirations, Ken immersed himself in Kenny’s passion for the sport.</p><p>He attended every practice and game, provided equipment, and imparted the fundamental skills of football. His love and encouragement laid the foundation for Kenny’s budding career.</p><p>Tragically, Ken Vaccaro battled emphysema, a lung disease that eventually claimed his life when Kenny was just 16 years old.
