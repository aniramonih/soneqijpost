In a new interview with Entertainment Tonight, Kirstie reveals one of the bombshells in her book – that she was “in love” with Patrick Swayze when they were both married to other people and working on a TV movie together, “North and South,” in 1985. Kirstie would have been 34 at the time, and Swayze was 33. While she insists they did not have an “affair,” she admits that they were emotionally involved, adding “I think what we did was worse.” In Kristie’s mind, the fact that Patrick turned her down didn’t mean he wasn’t into her at all. This excerpt, from ET, leaves out the detail that Kirstie “propositioned Patrick one night, but he turned her away.”</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/northsouth.jpg alt title=northsouth width=600 sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Kirstie Alley reveals to ET’s Chris Jacobs intimate details about what she says was a powerful attraction and hidden relationship with her North and South co-star, Patrick Swayze. Although both stars were married during filming of the mini-series, Alley tells Jacobs when she first saw Swayze, they had an intense attraction and she tried to avoid “going down that road,” but they ultimately fell in love.</p><p>“Both of us were married. We did not have an affair. But again, I think what I did was worse. Because I think when you fall in love with someone when you’re married, you jeopardize your own marriage and their marriage. It’s doubly bad,” said Alley.</p><p>Alley goes on to say that although she’s friends with Patrick’s wife, Lisa Niemi, who asked Alley to speak at Swayze’s funeral, she is uncertain if Lisa is aware of their relationship.</p><p><a href=#>[From ET Online]</a></p><p>Kirstie also told ET that “after Patrick, I made a decision that I was not ever going to involve myself with anyone married.” Here’s the thing, Kirstie was on her second marriage at the time of her affair/flirtation with Patrick Swayze. She was also 34, more than old enough to know better, and of course she would have had a relationship with him, but Patrick turned her down! Still he was “in love” with her. Hopefully Patrick’s widow, Lisa Niemi, realizes that her late husband didn’t go there and that Kirstie is deluded.</p><p>In another interview, with Barbara Walters, <a href=#>Kirstie called John Travolta</a> the “greatest love of my life” and claimed that while they were filming Look Who’s Talking, in 1989, “It took everything that I had, inside, outside, whatever, to not run off and marry John. And be with John for the rest of my life.” John didn’t marry Kelly Preston until 1991, but Kirstie was married at that time. She said she didn’t hook up with Travolta because “I feel like when you marry someone you’re supposed to work hard at it, and you’re supposed to make it work.” So she avoided married men after she learned from her experience getting rejected by Patrick Swayze, but it didn’t seem to matter that she was married. She’s calling some guy the “love of her life” who was only her buddy and co-star and likely wasn’t interested in her at all, considering that she’s a woman. She thinks men are much more into her than they are. It’s possible she’s full of it though, and is just name-dropping in order to promote her book. Given that she’s talking about a beloved departed actor, that scenario would be more despicable than her “secret relationship” claims which fall flat.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/wenn4069307-708x1024.jpg alt title=wenn4069307 width=500 sizes="(max-width: 708px) 100vw, 708px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/wenn5905040-682x1024.jpg alt title=wenn5905040 width=500 sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photo credit: WENN.com</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZma25haoZ3e8qiqaysmZqsorjLnrCYm5yWtq6%2Fvq2fnqZdoq6zvsiem5iokam%2Fqq%2FKmKqwmamvsqDDwKyWoqaPoby3sb6woK2gj52ys6vEr5ynl6SdvLazx5ifnpekqr%2BvscOYn56qj5m8uLqO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kim-ji-yeon.html><span>←</span><span>Kim Ji-yeon Biography, Age, Height, Husband, Net Worth, Family</span></a>
