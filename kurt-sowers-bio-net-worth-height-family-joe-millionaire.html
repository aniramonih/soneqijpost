He wants his future wife to fill his life with laughter.

And when I am apart from them, I can’t wait to get back to them.” Also, he added that he was a “born competitor” and if he does something, he does it to win it.</span></p><p><span>Guess, he was set on finding love.</span></p><p><span>The contestants vying for Kurt’s heart this season were — Suzan, Amanda Pace, Calah Jackson, Breanna Hagen, Amber, Andreea Natalia, Caroline Campbell, Doris Josie Cano, Annie Jorgensen, Jennie Alexandra, Carolyn Moore, Brookell, Rachel Vinson, Monica Aksamit, Katy Johnson, Sara Rose, Suzette James, and two other.</span></p><p><span>Each one of them flaunts an amazing personality.

They know one of us is wealthier than the other, they just don’t know which is which,” he added.</span></p><p><span>As to answer if Kurt found love this season, we’ll just have to wait and see.
