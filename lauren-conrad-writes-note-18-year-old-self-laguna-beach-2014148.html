She went on to be featured prominently on the show and become the star of its spin-off series The Hills. Today she’s a best-selling author, fashion designer, and is planning her wedding to fiancé <strong>William Tell</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking back at her action-packed decade, Conrad, 28, took to her blog, <a href=#>LaurenConrad.com</a>, to write a note to her 18-year-old self one month before the anniversary of Laguna Beach.&nbsp;</p><p>“In light of my 10-year reunion, I’ve been doing a little reflecting,” she started the letter. “Well, 18-year-old Lauren, here’s my advice…”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>The California native encouraged her younger self to wear sunscreen, noting that she’s moved on from wanting the “sun-kissed glow” and now opts for her natural skin tone.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She also suggested enjoying youth. “When I was 18, I was in a hurry to grow up. Instead, I wish I would have taken a beat to just enjoy being young. So many things are new when you’re that age and the level of responsibility is still low.”</p><p>Finally, Conrad encouraged herself to be an individual.&nbsp;</p><p>“For the first time you get to go off on your own and make real, conscious decisions about where you want life to take you,” she wrote. “You get to choose your school, your major, and what kind of person you’ll become. So when you’re making these decisions, be an individual. It’s the best way to discover who you really are.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKOaraKau26vzqepmpxdrL%2BqwMSsZKenpJp6coSMspyaql2kuaV50p6jn2WclrS2usBmmZ6Zk516c3yQbWhtcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kurt-suzuki-wife-wiki-salary-family-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Kurt Suzuki Wife, Wiki, Salary, Family, Net Worth</span></a>
