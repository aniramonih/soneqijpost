Laurie is loosely portrayed by actress <a href=#>Cheryl Hines</a> on "Curb Your Enthusiasm." She is also a notable environmentalist who won an Academy Award for producing the 2006 documentary "An Inconvenient Truth."</p><p>According to an interview with Larry a decade after their divorce, Laurie received half of his of <a href=#>Larry David's net worth</a> as a settlement. An amount that was easily in the several hundred million dollar range.</p><h2 id=early-life-career><strong>Early Life and Career</strong></h2><p>Laurie Ellen Lennard was born in Long Island, New York on March 22, 1958. She graduated from Ohio University in 1979 with a degree in journalism.</p><p>She worked as a talent coordinator for "Late Night with <a href=# title="David Letterman Net Worth">David Letterman</a>" from 1983 to 1985.

She was production consultant for the TV series "Get a Life" from 1990 to 1992.</p><p>She married Larry David in 1993 and they had two daughters together, <a href=#>Cazzie David</a> (born in 1994) and Romy (born in 1996).</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-293656 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ld2.png alt="Laurie David Net Worth" width=703 height=635 sizes="(max-width: 703px) 100vw, 703px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-293656 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In 1998 Laurie and David paid $1.26 million for a home in LA's Pacific Palisades neighborhood. They ultimately purchased two neighboring parcels to put together a roughly 1-acre parcel with sweeping ocean views. Laurie remained in this house after the couple separated in 2007. They listed this home for sale in September 2013 for $15 million, ultimately accepting $12 million in March 2014.</p><p>Laurie David owns a 14-acre estate in the Hamptons that features seven structures and a second home in Martha's Vineyard. In 2005 and 2009 Laurie received a citation from the Chilmark Conservation Commission for paving over wetlands at her property.</p><h2 id=environmental-activism><strong>Environmental Activism</strong></h2><p>Laurie has described herself as being "obsessed" with global warming and other environmental causes. Laurie was the reason Larry drove a Prius in the early seasons of "Curb Your Enthusiasm. At the time, a super rich celebrity driving a Prius was considered quirky and unusual.</p><p>She produced the 2006 <a href=# title="Al Gore Net Worth">Al Gore</a> documentary "An Inconvenient Truth," and has also produced the films "Sour Grapes," "GMO OMG," "Fed Up in 2014," "The Last Animals," "The Biggest Little Farm," and "The Social Dilemma.".

The foundation has supported numerous initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable agricultural practices. This venture has allowed David to broaden her impact and support a wide range of projects aimed at creating a sustainable future.</p><h2 id=private-jet-usage><strong>Private Jet Usage</strong></h2><p>As a vocal environmentalist, Laurie David has been criticized for her usage of private jets for personal travel. In response to the criticism, Laurie explained to The Guardian:</p><p>"<strong>Yes, I take a private plane on holiday a couple of times a year, and I feel horribly guilty about it. I probably shouldn't do it. But the truth is, I'm not perfect. This is not about perfection. I don't expect anybody else to be perfect either. That's what hurts the environmental movement – holding people to a standard they cannot meet. That just pushes people away.</strong>"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6o8HSoqWeq6Oisq97z6umna2Tmr%2B0e8uarKuhlWKxosLInWSnnaRixLC%2B06Fm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lauren-summer.html><span>←</span><span>Lauren Summer Onlyfans, Wiki, Age, Bio: She flashed in a baseball match</span></a>
