"She was so beautiful and very tall. It's almost like in <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Lord of the Rings</a></strong> when Galadriel walks into the room – it's kind of like that feeling. I think every sci-fi nerd will understand what that is. She just seemed so different; not removed, not aloof, nothing like that, she was very nice but when you looked at her you just felt, she's not one of us!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/33bc6aa8c164-princess-diana-attends-miss-saigon-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=emJPfsAljNpn data-wc=11><strong>Princess Diana attended a charity performance of Miss Saigon in 1989</strong></p><p id=e8b9lv86ViOU data-wc=58>Lea, who lent her singing voice to Princess Jasmine in the hit 1992 Disney classic , said: "It was almost like she was floating. I remember she was wearing a sky blue, very flowy gown with a matching scarf, a very long one that ran down her back. I just remember she floated. She didn't walk, she floated."</p><p id=eJ9ACyp2szMY data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Buckingham Palace announces another royal engagement</a></strong></p><p id=ezIODvmvNWhy data-wc=64>A few years later, the actress had the chance to perform in front of <a class=hm-link href=#>the Queen</a> and <a class=hm-link href=#>Prince Philip</a> at the Royal Variety Show. Admitting that she was a little starstruck, Lea said: "It can be a little intimidating when you see these people and you know who they are and their place in history.

She spent pretty much an equal amount of time with everyone. It never felt like she was rushing through the line. And the cool thing with that – you feel like you're seen. There's eye contact, there's a smile and even though it's very polite and I don't think she remembers even five percent of the people she's met, you feel like you mattered even if your exchange lasted all of five seconds, which was very sweet."</p><p id=eUHDsk7vkCDN data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Chris Evans welcomes twins with wife Natasha</a></strong></p><p id=eIbKjDb6316P data-wc=38>Lea added of Prince Philip: "And her husband had a really nice sense of humour.

Ahead of her comeback, the Disney star, who also voiced Fa Mulan in , said: "To get to perform in the West End and in the London Palladium, I'm very excited. It's something I'm really looking forward to. Fans can expect to hear the songs that they're wanting to hear from and . I usually pull someone out of the crowd to do a duet with me to . We have some incredible singers who come up on the stage and I usually end up with my jaw on the floor, so I'm hoping London will provide!"</p><p id=e23hFN2uyi8e data-wc=70>Despite having performed thousands of times, the humble star, who was the first Asian woman to win a Tony Award, admitted: "I absolutely get nervous, even if I've done a show 100 times, even if it's songs I have sung literally thousands of times. It never gets old. That feeling of excitement and nervousness, slight panic and anxiety, I think that's a good thing – because it means you care."</p><p id=ew60AZ449NTr data-wc=8>Tickets for Lea's show are available at .</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
