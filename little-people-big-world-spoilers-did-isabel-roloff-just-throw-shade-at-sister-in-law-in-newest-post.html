What happened? Let’s find out more about the so-called shade being thrown.</p><h2>Little People, Big World Spoilers – Isabel’s Time With Her Niece</h2><p><a href=#>This past weekend, Isabel shared some photos</a> of herself with her niece and Audrey’s daughter, Ember. She captioned one of the photos, “Bouquet by Ember. She gave me the okay on this photo.” Isabel also shared the beautiful flowers that Ember added to the bouquet. This photo was extremely adorable and her fans were quick to share what they thought about it.</p><p>Interestingly enough, Isabel has kept her own son, Mateo off of social media. She wants him to be able to make the choice about being on a public site.</p><p>This is not something she wants to expose her children to much like Audrey does every day. Isabel has made it clear time and time again that she feels as if children should not be all over social media at such a young age.</p><p>Anyone can look at these photos of children all day long.</p><p><img alt="Audrey Roloff" width=800 height=409 data-jpibfi-post-excerpt data-jpibfi-post-url=https://celebbabylaundry.com/2023/08/little-people-big-world-spoilers-did-isabel-roloff-just-throw-shade-at-sister-in-law-in-newest-post/ data-jpibfi-post-title="Little People, Big World Spoilers: Did Isabel Roloff Just Throw Shade At Sister-In-Law In Newest Post?" data-jpibfi-src sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebbabylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Audrey-Roloff-6.jpg></p><h3>Little People, Big World Updates – Fans React</h3><p>As soon as her fans saw this post, they wanted to share what they thought about it. One wrote, “I appreciate Isabel’s attempt in getting Ember’s consent.” Another added, “Some adults like Audrey don’t understand just how far a picture can go online.”</p><p><a href=#>One more threw in,</a> “I think it’s a little dig considering in actuality Audrey decided to violate Ember’s privacy before she was even born. And she continues to do so because it brings in the money.” A final fan added, “Because Audrey constantly posts and shares her kids’ every single move. Isabel shows very little, if anything of hers, and has strong views about it.”</p><p>The comments did go on, but from the looks of it, Isabel has gotten more praise for actually asking her niece to pose for a picture with her instead of just sharing it online.</p><p>Isabel continues to share a lot with her fans, but there is one thing that fans won’t see for many years and that is the face of her son.</p><p>Isabel knows what can happen when people overshare on social media especially those in the spotlight. She is doing everything that she can to protect her family at this point.</p><p>Be sure to catch up on everything happening with Little People, Big World right now. <a href=#>Come back here often for Little People, Big World spoilers, news, and updates.</a></p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo67Am7ClmaWjsbPFjZympmdiZX90e49xZqWhpKm5pnnPnqappJVir6qzjLCmq6SUYsCxu8ilnKurXZm2pXnIrJibnZxiv7C4zp%2BdZqKlqMFuwMerprBlo52upbGMmqtmq5mowaa%2BjKKlZqSRrHqquoynnLCdo6l6sbvSrWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./devon-sawa-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Devon Sawa Net Worth</span></a>
