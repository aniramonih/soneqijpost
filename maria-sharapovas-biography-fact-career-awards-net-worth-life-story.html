Sharapova made her professional breakthrough in 2004, at age 17, when she defeated two-time defending champion and Serena Williams in 2004 Wimbledon final to win her first Grand Slam singles title, becoming the 3rd youngest woman to win the Wimbledon title, behind Martina Hingis and Lottie Dod. Despite not having good record on court, Sharapova remains the top-earning female athlete in the world according to Forbes Magazine. In June 2012, Maria Sharapova won the first set in her French Open tennis final against Italy’s Sara Errani, to reclaim the title as World No.&nbsp;1.</p><p>Sharapova’s portfolio extends beyond tennis, she has been featured in several high-profile modeling assignments, like Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, and in many advertisements with Nike, Prince and Canon, and as face of several fashion houses like Cole Haan. She renewed her Nike deal worth $70&nbsp;million at the start of 2010 and it has been very lucrative for the number one as she receives royalties on her own line of apparel which was up 26% in 2010, as well as for her ballet flat which was the top selling shoe in 2010 at Cole Haan, a Nike subsidiary. Sharapova was born on April 19, 1987 in Nyagan, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union. She is currently engaged to basketball player, Sasha Vujacic, who plays for Anadolu Efes S.K. in Istanbul.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKWRp7aiedKhmKuZoKTDor%2BMm6Con6KWvanFjJ%2BYnKxdmK6zscSrZJqvkaextHnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal5y6KdnmWjqbyzxY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lee-trevino-net-worth-2020-2021.html><span>←</span><span>Lee Trevino Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</span></a>
