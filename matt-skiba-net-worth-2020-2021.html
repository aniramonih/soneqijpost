Well, if you’re ready, let’s start.</p><h2>Early Life</h2><p>Matt Skiba spent a small part of his early childhood in Chicago, Illinois, his birthplace. When he was three years old, his family moved to the town of McHenry. The first instruments that he learned to play when he was young were drums and piano. He had to work as a part-time bike messenger to pay his bills as an adolescent.</p><p>It was during this time that he stopped playing the drums and picked up the guitar.

Constant changes never allowed Alkaline Trio to find their authentic sound.</p><p>Matt Skiba, ironically, joined Blink-182 after Tom DeLonge left the band. He joined the punk rock music group as a temporary member, touring a couple of times, for a few shows. After understanding the type of music that Blink-182 espoused, Matt made subtle changes to his style of writing, singing and playing to fit into the band more easily. The hard work paid off, as later on, the members of Blink-182 announced that Matt Skiba had become a permanent member of their band.</p><h2>Awards and Achievements</h2><p>Matt Skiba has become one of the <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">biggest names in punk rock music</a>.
