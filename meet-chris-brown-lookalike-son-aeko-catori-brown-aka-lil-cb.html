<span>Billy Koelling</span></p><h1>Meet Chris Brown's Lookalike Son Aeko Catori Brown, AKA &amp;quot;Lil CB&amp;quot;</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Aeko Catori Brown was born to famous singer Chris Brown and social media model Ammika Harris in November 2019. But other than what his parents share on social media, little is known about him.&nbsp;</p><p>It is also unclear what relationship Chris and Ammika share since they welcomed their child. Plus, the singer has two other children with different mothers.&nbsp;</p><p>The only certainty is that Chris and Ammika are on cordial terms, and he once tagged her as his “baby.” This leaves what they share open to speculation, but neither has confirmed or denied being together romantically.&nbsp;</p><p>Aeko Catori Brown’s birthday is <a href=#>celebrated</a> every year on November 20th. He was born in California, USA. However, the hospital where the delivery happened is unknown.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/aekoo.jpg><p>He has two siblings, both girls. The first, Royalty Brown, is Chris’s child from his relationship with Nia Guzman in 2014. The other is Lovely Symphani, from the singer’s relationship with Diamond Brown; she was born in 2022.</p><p>As earlier stated, most of what is known about Aeko is gleaned from his parents’ social media posts. Ammika is very big on sharing pictures of the cute boy on her social media pages.&nbsp;</p><p>She shares pictures and videos of him on Instagram and Snapchat. Although Chris has shared images of Aeko, he doesn’t do so often. This is because he prefers to keep his private life separate from his life as a singer.</p><p>The most famous thing Chris has shared about Aeko was a promo video for his song “Go Crazy.” The footage captured the little boy dancing to the music and immediately went viral.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Aeko_Catori_Brown_Looks_Just_Like_Chris></span>Aeko Catori Brown Looks Just Like Chris<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>One of the most remarkable things about Aeko is that he looks like <a href=#>a younger version</a> of his father. Chris has noticed this too, and he once called the boy “Lil CB” in an Instagram post.&nbsp;</p><p>Since then, his fans have continued calling Aeko that, and given how true it is, the nickname will most likely stick forever. In another rare footage of Aeko that Chris shared on his Instagram, he sounded fascinated by how his son spoke.&nbsp;</p><p>In the video, he repeatedly talked about how Aeko looked exactly like him. The resemblance between the father and son is not restricted to their nose shape or eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>Their entire facial features look the same, and looking at Aeko is like seeing an infant Chris Brown. There are not many pictures of a young Chris on social media. However, those who have seen his school photos know they look like clones of each other.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-93.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Fans_Think_About_Their_Resemblance></span>What Fans Think About Their Resemblance&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Chris and Aeko’s uncanny resemblance has not gone unnoticed by his fans. Whenever a post of Aeko appears on social media, fans are always quick to point out how similar he looks to Chris in the comments.&nbsp;</p><p>Fan pages regularly upload pictures of the pair side-by-side on Instagram. Also, some fans conducted polls asking netizens if they thought Chris and Aeko looked similar. Each time, the answer was always yes.&nbsp;</p><p>Chris’s <a href=#>life changed</a> as soon as he became a dad, causing him to reduce his musical activities to prioritize time with family. After the birth of Aeko, the singer discovered that his heart could love even more than he thought possible.</p><p>Those close to Chris said he didn’t know he could love another child as much as&nbsp;he loves Royalty. But when Aeko was born, the love increased, and his children brought out the best in him. Chris makes time for his family, and aside from releasing an album in 2022, and has only participated in a few musical projects.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Relationship_Between_Aeko_Catori_Brown_and_His_Siblings></span>The Relationship Between Aeko Catori Brown and His Siblings&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Aeko and his siblings may share different mothers, but they all get along well. In 2019, after Aeko was born, Chris shared a picture that captured Royalty getting to know him.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/royalty.jpg><p>She <a href=#>looked fascinated</a> as she stared down at the infant Aeko, and it melted many hearts. At the time, some fans spotted the resemblance between Chris and Aeko and pointed it out.&nbsp;</p><p>Chris’s fans can’t wait for Aeko to get older to see if the resemblance remains. But whether he looks more or less like his dad, Aeko Catori Brown will always be “Lil CB” to the world.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuqax02aaoaqZqHqjvs6wpWakn6S4orjIpJxmq5%2BjeqKxyqhknJmkpL%2BqecGrprCmXZa4onnLoqNmm5Jk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marco-robinson-net-worth-income-salary-html.html><span>←</span><span>Marco Robinson Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
