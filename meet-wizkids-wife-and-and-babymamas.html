Without any doubt, we can say that Ayodeji Balogun, aka Wizkid, has been one of Nigeria’s biggest exports in the music industry, with multiple hit songs under his belt, both locally and internationally. Apart from being known for his chart-topping music, he is also famous for his colourful personal life."><meta name=author content="Tandra Barner"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Apart from being known for his chart-topping music, he is also famous for his colourful personal life.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Presently, he is not married but has had several relationships that have resulted in children. Wizkid’s baby mama tally currently rests at the number three, with a total number of four children. Here, we will immediately delve into his marital status, baby mamas, and the children he shares with them.</span></p><h2><b>Does Wizkid Have a Wife?</b></h2><p><span>Wizkid is not yet married, so he does not have a wife. For an artist as famous as Wizkid, information about his private life has been particularly difficult to come by. Everyone knows about Wizkid’s multiple baby mamas but that cannot be said about his marital status, as there have been speculations about him</span><span> being married since he started making waves in the music industry.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Wizkid has been romantically linked to several individuals, including fellow Nigerian musician <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Tiwa Savage</a>. However, these relationships have often been characterized by mere speculation and have not led to confirmed marriages. In his usual pattern of silence, the artist has never bothered to officially confirm or deny the rumours about his non-existent marital life. As of now, however, it is best to say that Ayo Balogun is not married.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Wizkid has never made any public declaration of love or announced his engagement to anyone. Like a true Nigerian hustler, his focus has primarily been on his music career, and given all the international recognition and success he has achieved in the music industry, you could definitely say that it paid off handsomely for him.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>How Many Baby Mamas Does Wizkid Have?</b></h2><p><span>Wizkid has three Babymamas. While there have been rumours and speculations about a potential fourth baby mama, this has not been officially confirmed by any reputable source yet. For now, the confirmed number of Wizkid’s Babymamas remains three.</span></p><p><span>The Grammy award-winning singer might not have put a ring on anyone’s fingers yet, but he certainly runs a full house. His first baby mama is Shola Ogudu, the second is Binta Diallo, and the third is Jada Pollock. Wizkid’s Babymamas has four children altogether — one each from the first two and two from Jada. His first child is Boluwatife Balogun, his second is Ayodeji Balogun, and his third is Zion Balogun. The name and gender of Wizkid’s youngest child remains hidden from the public.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Despite not being married, the “Pakurumo” crooner has done his best to maintain cordial relationships with the mothers of his children. His commitment to being a responsible father to his kids is evident, even though the dynamics of co-parenting can be challenging, and some of his baby mamas disagree with his co-parenting style. Still, Wizkid continues to focus on his music and his personal life only makes gossip headlines occasionally.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>Who Are Wizkid’s Babymamas?</b></h2><p><span>Wizkid’s babymamas are Shola Ogudu, Binta Diallo, and Jada Pollock. These women happen to be the women he met in the course of pursuing his passion for music. When he met his first baby mama, Shola, he reportedly had a very long relationship with her, and she has remained the only one among his baby mamas that he properly dated. They are also said to have a good co-parenting relationship.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Binta, on the other hand, has severely accused Wizkid of being an absentee father, while&nbsp; Jada, seems to have a good relationship with him. We certainly wish Wizkid and all his family members all the help they can get, especially regarding co-parenting. Meanwhile, here is more in-depth information on who Wizkid’s baby mamas actually are.</span></p><h2><b>Wizkid’s First Baby Mama is Shola Ogudu</b></h2><p><span>Oluwanishola Ogudu, more popularly known as Shola Ogudu, is Wizkid’s first baby mama and former girlfriend. She is a 33-year-old fashion entrepreneur who met Wizkid when they were both teenagers. They dated for some time, which resulted in the birth of Boluwatife Balogun, in 2011.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Unfortunately, Shola and Wizkid’s relationship turned rocky almost immediately. The “Essence” singer was reported to have denied the pregnancy at first. He refused to acknowledge the baby until a DNA test was carried out. Wizkid and Shola eventually parted ways because of his growing music career which made him unable to provide the much-needed attention to his family.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In a strange twist, though, the former couple seem to be doing much better as co-parents than as lovers. Despite their rough separation, they both have a good relationship and are co-parenting their son together. Shola also supports and consistently promotes Wizkid’s music career on her social media pages. Shola’s son, Boluwatife, is currently 12 years old and sits as Wizkid’s oldest child and direct heir.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>Binta Diallo is Wizkid’s Second Babymama</b></h2><p><span>Binta Diallo Diamond is the second of Wizkid’s babymamas. She is a Guinean-American model who met Wizkid while she was a student living in the United States. The two had a brief casual romance, which resulted in the birth of their son, Ayodeji Ibrahim Balogun Jr., in 2016. However, this relationship has been fraught with plenty of issues.</span></p><p><span>A few years ago, Binta took to social media to accuse Wizkid of being an absentee father and failing to take care of their son’s needs. She went on Instagram to vent her frustrations, but Wizkid, in return, accused her of being a gold digger. Their relationship has continued to be marked by public disputes and legal battles over child support.</span></p><p><span>Presently, there seems to be a lull in the social media onslaughts from both parties. We can only hope that this means they’ve chosen to put aside their differences for the sake of their 7-year-old son.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>Jada Pollock is Wizkid’s Third and Last Babymama</b></h2><p><span>Jada Pollock is Wizkid’s third babymama. She is a British-Nigerian brand consultant and artist manager who worked with Wizkid for many years. Jada also manages Wizkid’s music career, and their professional relationship has positively influenced his personal life and brand image.</span></p><p><span>Wizkid’s third baby mama, Jada, was certainly no small fish, whether before or after she met him. She used to be a stylist for Gucci. She was known to hang around global superstars like Chris Brown. In 2012, she and Wizkid had their first encounter at the singer’s concert in Lagos. From a simple working relationship, the two progressively began a romantic relationship and eventually welcomed a son together. </span><span>His name was Zion Ayo Balogun, and he was born in 2017.</span></p><p><span>Although it has only been implied, Zion, despite being the youngest of the Balogun brothers, appears to be the most famous. There are also indications that he is Wizkid’s favorite kid too, as suggested by the artist’s actions. Jada is also the only baby mama who has not publicly accused Wizkid of being an absentee father. They both have a good relationship and are still reportedly dating.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In late October 2022, Wizkid and Jada welcomed a second child together, and Wizkid’s fourth child overall. While the singer has not yet made any public comments about his newest baby, he has uploaded pictures of himself holding the child. It’s believed that this fourth child is a girl, however, there is really no reliable confirmation on the child’s gender yet as it was a bit difficult to tell from the few available pictures.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK57zJ6crWWnnsestcOsZLChlpp6orrDZpinnF2XrqPFzJqkmqtf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michael-chiarello-wife.html><span>←</span><span>Meet His Wife Eileen Chiarello And Children</span></a>
