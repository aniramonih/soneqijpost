For the outing, she swapped her long copper locks for <a href=#>a vibrant hairpiece</a>, which was parted down the middle and styled in a wavy bob. She teamed the tresses with an <a href=#>oversized blazer dress</a>, thigh-high <a href=#>snakeskin boots</a>, a leather bag, chunky silver chokers and black sunglasses.</p><p>MGK, 33, for his part, opted for a denim puffer jacket, matching pants and a striped shirt underneath. His blonde hair was teased and gelled in a spikey ‘do, and he accessorized with white sunglasses.</p><p>While Fox looks fantastic in the bright red bob, her signature hair color is black. She first revealed her chestnut mane at the<a href=#> 2023 Vanity Fair Oscar Party</a>. The actress has also donned long pastel pink hair, icy blonde strands, brunette tresses and more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Megan-Fox-Unveils-Cherry-Red-Bob-on-Lunch-Date-With-Machine-Gun-Kelly-2.jpg><p>One of her most talked about hair moments came at the 2022 Billboard Music Festival. For the awards, Fox rocked <a href=#>wispy bangs</a> that were cut slightly below her eyebrows. Her long longs were worn down and straightened. She added even more edge to the ensemble with a David Koma gown featuring <a href=#>a plunging neckline</a>, slit as high as her hips and 3-D sleeves finished with bedazzled floral details.</p><p>For the event, she posed next to her fiancé, whose hair was dyed <a href=#>pink at the time</a>. MGK wore a Dolce & Gabbana cropped studded jacket, bejeweled shirt, spikey pants and leather boots.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The couple met on the set of Midnight In The Switchgrass in March 2020 and started dating in June of that year. MGK then <a href=#>got on one knee</a> in January 2022 and shared the exciting news via Instagram. “‘Yes, in this life and every life’ beneath the same branches we fell in love under, i brought her back to ask her to marry me,” he captioned a photo of<a href=#> her engagement ring</a>. “I know tradition is one ring, but i designed it with Stephen Webster to be two: the emerald (her birth stone) and the diamond (my birth stone) set on two magnetic bands of thorns that draw together as two halves of the same soul forming the obscure heart that is our love.”</p><p>Although the duo have spent some time apart after a source told Us Weekly they had a “big fight,” in February they are currently back together and planning their wedding. “They are both on board again and are excited to start planning the new version <a href=#>of their wedding</a>,” an insider told Us in July 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6KyqK3NZp2osF2qu7exyKWqZpqinrSpwIyrnJ1lkqSvbsPIrZ9mpZGYtaq6xGaerqZdoLKtuNho</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./matthew-morton-19980702-html.html><span>←</span><span>Matthew Morton (Entrepreneur) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
