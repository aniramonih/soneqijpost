The former professional baseball player, 49, <a href=#>spoke to Us Weekly exclusively about their divorce and allegations that he cheated</a> on his wife with one of their four nannies, <strong>Carly Wilson</strong>.</p><p>“It’s dangerous, irresponsible and hurtful to all to allow a rumor to be spread to the world because of insecurities,” the athlete said.</p><p><a href=#>Wilson also denied the affair</a>, telling a commenter on Instagram that the accusations are “completely false.”</p><p><a href=#>Meghan confronted them</a> a week before the split, a source told Us.&nbsp;“The nanny is someone who has worked for them for years and is like family,” the insider said. “During the argument [about it], Meghan called the cops, but nothing came of it. Jim didn’t put his hands on her. The police chalked it up to a verbal dispute. No arrests were made.”</p><p>In June, Jim was caught sending inappropriate texts to a woman Us later identified as <a href=#><strong>Jennifer McFelia Villegas</strong></a>. Meghan addressed the messages<a href=#> in a blog post</a> at the time, writing, “I love him. How can I turn my feelings around so quickly? How can one person decide to utterly ruin me? It’s not fair. I sob so much my face stings from the salt from my tears. I am exhausted. My poor kids aren’t getting their devoted mother. And it’s only been 36 hours.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#>Jim denied having a “physical relationship”</a> with the woman, telling Us exclusviely, “I had a lapse in judgment.”</p><p>The estranged couple tied the knot in 2014.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGamnZedrq95yqKloGWVmbqwusOsZKmno5rAbsPIrZ9mo5mZwG6t02anrqWgoLavec%2Baq5ygXZu8rbjOsKCnn12ova2102g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mauricio-ochmann-wife-parents-biography-quick-facts.html><span>←</span><span>Mauricio Ochmann Wife, Parents, Biography, Quick Facts</span></a>
