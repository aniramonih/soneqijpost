He had grown up wandering around in nature, trying to figure out meaning and purpose and pondering on the big picture. At the same time, he could draw and sculpt via which he expressed his thoughts and ideas. However, he would keep to himself and never share his thoughts with those around him.</li><li>He has recollected that his interest in nature and art had brought him to study architecture, which is a combination of the two. The architecture of nature had, in turn, led him to water.</li><li>Moses has believed that water shapes our world, our environment as well as our future, having marveled at how the fluid dwells in our bodies.</li><li>Faces of Water had been the debut of his technique that has captured the invisible forms of water. He has worked out a technique that has involved a special kind of film with a layer of liquid that can record the movement of the water itself.</li><li>He has stated that he has looked for words that have the potential to help us heal and learn about our unity and equality.</li><li>Hacmon has deemed it important to understand that our planet is a closed system with us being one body of water and that improving our relationship to water will automatically improve personal health as well as global sustainability. He has striven to provide education online, for which he launched Channel Water on YouTube in November 2016, the family-friendly portal having published free information and resources to study about water.</li><p>Featured Image by Moses Hacmon / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqamrJ2jYrWir8yopWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mo-vlogs.html><span>←</span><span>Mo Vlogs net worth, Kids, Age, Wife, Bio-Wiki, Weight</span></a>
