She loved him, but their lifestyle soon proved to be an issue. "Any dreams of exclusivity went out the window," she wrote in her 2022 memoir "Rebel Soul: Musings, Music, & Magic" (via&nbsp;<a href=#>Fox News</a>). They continued to be in each other's lives — but so were other people. "[Infidelity came] with the rock star territory, or at least that's what it felt like," she contended.</p><p>During and shortly after their on-again, off-again relationship, Buell had flings with some of the most prominent figures in rock history: Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones, Rod Stewart, Jimmy Page of the Led Zeppelin, Elvis Costello, and, of course, Steven Tyler, just to name a few. Rundgren also enjoyed his fair share of affairs, but his girlfriends weren't as high-profile. "Todd would always be f***ing these nondescript road tramps," she harshly described in her 2001 memoir "Rebel Heart: An American Rock 'n' Roll Journey" (via <a href=#>Salon</a>).</p><p>For her involvement with rockers, Buell has been described as a groupie, having served as one of the inspirations for the 2000 film "Almost Famous." But Buell dislikes the term because she wasn't simply following rock stars around — she was also a musician. "I was a fashion model who, yes, dated very interesting and fascinating men. But music had been there from the very beginning," she told Fox News. She fit in. But her priorities changed after her daughter Liv came along.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamppbIR5g46mpq2glad6sLKMrKuerpWjerXFy56pZpyRqrSpwMSrZKWhpmK%2FsK%2FKrKuaql2lrrTAjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-walk-like-an-egyptian-by-the-bangles.html><span>←</span><span>The Meaning Behind The Song: Walk Like an Egyptian by The Bangles</span></a>
