Best Life</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Charles Shaughnessy</strong> is best known for his role as the stuffy, yet dreadfully charming theater producer and father, Maxwell Sheffield, which he played on <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>The Nanny</a> opposite <strong>Fran Drescher</strong>. The British-born actor played the character for all six seasons of the show, from 1993 to 1999, and is also popular with soap fans, having been a fixture in daytime since he first appeared on&nbsp;Days of Our Lives&nbsp;in 1984. But despite being a steadily working TV actor (and <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>a Baron within the United Kingdom</a>, after inheriting the title), Shaughnessy has always been a low-key celebrity. Read on to find out what the now-67-year-old has been doing since he left Flushing, Queens.</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>She Played Marcy on Married… with Children. See Amanda Bearse Now at 63.</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Charles-Shaughnessy-in-1988.jpg><p>On Days of Our Lives, Shaughnessy played Shane Donovan, a secret agent sent to Salem to investigate Stefano DiMero, regularly from 1984 to 1992, and then off and on through 2021, including on the spinoff limited series,&nbsp;Days of Our Lives: Beyond Salem. (He also played Shane's identical twin brother, Drew.) But while he'll always be Shane to some, Shaughnessy's most recent soap opera role is on General Hospital, where he took over the role of Victor Cassadine, who had previously been played by <strong>Thaao Penghlis</strong> and was presumed to be dead for seven years. Shaughnessy said of the role <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>to Soap Opera Digest</a>, "It's really kind of unique to the soap universe that you can do this. That a character will die and be resurrected by different actors. In the soap world, you can take a character that's been established and put your twist on it, your little spin. It's a fun character, a complex character to play."</p><p>Shaughnessy is still recurring on&nbsp;General Hospital, and fans shouldn't count out another return to the&nbsp;Days of Our Lives&nbsp;universe either.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Charles-Shaughnessy-in-2003.jpg><p>After&nbsp;The Nanny&nbsp;ended, Shaughnessy had more on his plate than just soap operas. Over the years, he's appeared in shows including&nbsp;Mad Men,&nbsp;Veronica Mars,&nbsp;Castle,&nbsp;Modern Family, and&nbsp;NCIS. He's popped up in lots of children's shows, like Hannah Montana&nbsp;and&nbsp;Victorious, and several TV movies. The actor has also lent his distinguished voice to several video games.<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/The-Nanny-cast.jpg><p>The cast of&nbsp;The Nanny&nbsp;all appear to have remained close in the years since the sitcom went off the air. Recent reunions include Shaughnessy, <strong>Benjamin Salisbury</strong> (who played Brighton), Drescher, and&nbsp;<strong>Lauren Lane </strong>(who played C.C.) supporting <strong>Renée Taylor</strong>, who played Fran's mom Sylvia, at her one-woman show, My Life on a Diet, in 2019. (Pictured above.) Then, in 2021, Shaughnessy, his wife&nbsp;<strong>Susan Fallender</strong>, daughters&nbsp;<strong>Jenny&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Maddy</strong>, and son-in-law&nbsp;<strong>Jonathan</strong>&nbsp;battled it out with Drescher and her team <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>on </a><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Celebrity Family Feud</a>.</p><p>Given that every 1990s sitcom seems to have gotten a reboot, it's understandable that Shaughnessy and his former co-stars have been asked if they're interested. While he's skeptical that they could recapture the magic, he'd still want to be involved.</p><p>"It would be a lot of fun. It's hard because people see The Nanny now, it's 30 years old, so we're all different," <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Shaughnessy told People </a>in 2021. "I'm a lot older. [Drescher's] a lot older. The kids are a lot older. You see that and you kind of want to recreate that, but it's un-recreatable. I have questions about reboots, in general, but if someone comes up with it and offers me to revisit Maxwell Sheffield, I'd be delighted."</p><p><strong>RELATED: For more celebrity updates sent right to your inbox,&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>sign up for our daily newsletter</a>.<br></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Charles-Shaughnessy-in-2021.jpg><p>While everyone was holed up in their homes during the COVID lockdown, Shaughnessy hosted a podcast on Facebook Live called Conversations in Quarantine, sponsored by the Robert F. Kennedy Action Corps. He spoke to all sorts of people, including other actors from his soap operas and producers from The Nanny. While it's no longer ongoing, all of the videos <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>can be found on Facebook</a>.
