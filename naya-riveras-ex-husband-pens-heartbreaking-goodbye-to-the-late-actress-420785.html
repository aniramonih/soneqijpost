The actress didn’t just leave behind a family who loved her but also a 4-year-old she shared with her ex-husband.</p><p>Although the two were only married from 2014 to 2018, <a href=#>Naya</a> and Ryan Dorsey were close when co-parenting their toddler, Josey. <a href=#>Josey</a> was with his mom when she tragically went underwater and didn’t come back up after a day of swimming on a pontoon boat.</p><p>Days later, her body was found in Lake Piru. Authorities believe that she may have gotten caught in a current and only had the strength to push her son back up into the boat that wasn’t anchored down.</p><p>The lake does have a history of people drowning in it.</p><p>Weeks after the tragic accident, Ryan took to social media to say his final goodbye. He revealed that they were together just one day before her haunting death.</p><p>He took to Instagram to share a photo of Naya and Josey.</p><p>He accompanied it with a caption that read: ‘This is so unfair…there’s not enough words to express the hole left in everyone’s hearts. I can’t believe this is life now. I don’t know if I’ll ever believe it. You were just here… We were just in the back swimming with Josey the day before. Life just isn’t fair. I don’t know what to say…I’m thankful for our times and our journey that brought us together and gave us the sweetest and kindest smart little boy we could ever hope for. I remember sometimes you used to get annoyed at me: “Ryan can you stop snap chatting!” Haha. I’m glad I didn’t listen to you because I have hundreds and probably thousands of snaps and videos that Josey will have forever and know his momma loved him more than life, and how much fun we had together as he was growing up. Life is all about good times and bad times but with Josey it makes the bad a little less so because a part of you will always be with us. He’ll never forget where he came from. We miss you. We will always love you. Love you Meep. 🖤💔🖤’</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/CDFBvPRgOVC/</a></p><p>He added a note to the people who have reached out since the tragedy.</p><p>‘To everyone that reached out and I haven’t had a chance to or just didn’t get back to you…thank you all for the overwhelming love and support you’ve sent our way. I’ll just say in closing, be kind to yourself, be kind to others, forgive…forget…don’t hold grudges….if you have nothing nice to say maybe try not to say anything. There’s peace in silence. Time on Earth is precious and you just never know….you never know what could happen. Hold your loved ones close, and cherish the times you have with those you care about.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>His post was flooded with love from social media users.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeelsaiedGirZ6qkah6psSMoaysmpGjsW68xKeqZqCVlr%2B1rtGemKShnpx6qLvOnZmynV2pvG7Ax55kpZmkmnqir9OrnKyrXWl%2FcYOXbmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./muttiah-muralitharan-net-worth-203608.html><span>←</span><span>Muttiah Muralitharan Net Worth</span></a>
