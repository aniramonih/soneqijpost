She was 22 at the time and wed her British boyfriend, Max Parker, who was an IT consultant; the two reportedly met through mutual friends. It was apparently a "Scientology ceremony," with a well-known Scientologist, Fabiano Calcioli, being one of Parker's groomsmen. It's unsurprisingly Isabella who is the devoted Scientologist in the couple, not Parker.</p><p dir=ltr>The Daily Mail also wrote that even though Kidman was in London at the time working on a play, sources say she was forbidden from coming to the ceremony, as it was believed her appearance would cause a "media circus." It doesn't seem like there's any bad blood between Isabella and Kidman over this, at least. The outlet reported that she had dinner with Kidman and her husband-to-be the day before. And Kidman "was actually involved with the wedding preparations," a source told the Daily Mail. "But she didn't go to the ceremony. Also, the animosity between Tom and Nicole was probably a factor."</p><p>Speaking of Tom Cruise, he allegedly paid for Isabella's wedding, which was deemed "low-key but very expensive," but was not there. Isabella's adopted brother, Connor, was also not in attendance. Basically, none of this meant anything negative, as the purpose really seemed to be for the sake of keeping the ceremony small, intimate, and quiet, as <a href=#>People</a> reported.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampgaX1xgo6noJynnJp6rLXDppinZZGjsW7AzqZknKqlnsCmedaeqZ5lkqTBqXnNqGSsoJ%2BswG6t02aroZ2Zp3qlrdSgn62doqh6uLHDnaCnn18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./neal-brennan-net-worth-2020-2021.html><span>←</span><span>Neal Brennan Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Dating, Bio-Wiki</span></a>
