I love him. He’s the best.”</p><p>Xan credits “good chemistry” to their successful collaboration, though their work ethic is decidedly laid-back. “[We’re] just sitting on the coach, eating snacks, we’re lazy,” Xan said.</p><p>“I’m eating the snacks,” Cyrus said. “I’m the piggy.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>And when they’re not in the studio, they eat “a lot of sushi” and take drives around town, they told Us. “We’re just always traveling [and] scene cycling, so it’s a good time,” Xan said.</p><p>When asked about the most romantic gesture Xan has ever done, Cyrus initially showed off the bracelet he made for her. “No, that’s not my favorite,” she said, revising herself. “I don’t know, you’re always sweet. He’s always sweet. I don’t know. He gets me chicken nuggets. That’s the most romantic thing anyone can ever do for a girl.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGanp5GdeqTF0a6qZpmemXqttctmr5qmXZm2tLSMqKVmrJiatrN50Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipZJqmlGLBqbHIq2SmraOesHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nina-earl.html><span>←</span><span>Nina Eral and her NBA player husband, Russell Westbrook shares three kids, Jodyn, Noah, and Skye.</span></a>
