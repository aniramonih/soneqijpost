This was simply structured by some pastors or groups of people. They seek to practice a special approach to Christian worship.</p><p>There are, however, overlaps between traditional Protestant congregations and Non-Denominational church fellowships in terms of fundamental beliefs and worship. Some examples of Protestant congregations are; Presbyterian, Episcopal, Lutheran, and Methodist.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Read Also:&nbsp;<a href=#>What Is The Meaning Of Hosanna In The Bible?</a></p><h2><strong>The Growth of Non-Denominational Churches</strong></h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>The expansion of Non-Denominational churches has been rampant in modern-day history as reported by Universal Life Church in the United States of America. They clarified that their religion as Non-Denominational has surged up from 200,000 in 1990 to greater than 8 million by 2008.</p><p>Non-Denominational fellowships mostly incline toward the Bible itself and their main authority rather than the tradition of an ordinary church.</p><p>Also, unconventional churches permit more adaptability in Christian’s choice of worship. For example, some historic denominations have sunk into social topics. In this case, Non-Denominational fellowships are left baffled amidst politics whole channelling attention to social issues.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2><strong>Examples of Non-Denominational Churches</strong></h2><p><strong></strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>As we have said before, Non-Denominational churches are mostly established by some independent pastors or groups of people who seek to practice a special approach to the way Christiana worship.</p><p>However, some of them are structured to perform special activities to benefit an independent Christian organisation. Some examples of independent churches and organisations with their principles and purposes:</p><p><strong>Churches of Christ</strong>: Independent aspects of the Churches of Christ include getting their beliefs of faith from the Holy Bible. Members are baptised as adults and congregations are also governed by a cluster of church elders. Like other denominations, fellowships also partake in a weekly Eucharist. This church mostly uses musical instruments to worship</p><p><strong>Independent Christian Churches</strong>: These types of churches can be compared to the Churches of Christ. Independent churches support the central teachings of the Restoration Movement and believe in total obedience and respect for Jesus Christ.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p><strong>Association for a More Just Society</strong>: This is also a type of Non-Denominational church. They invite and let others do justice in their community, and follow their biblical studies and principles. This group of worshipers focus on fighting for peace, anti-corruption and public safety in their society.</p><p><strong>Hope Haven</strong>: This is a Non-Denominational church that strives to help others, especially with disabilities. It was founded in the year 1964 in Iowa, United States of America.</p><p>They provide jobs(i.e. living services, employment assistance, mental health and recovery, and religious) opportunities and train people with physical and hearing disabilities.</p><p>Read Also:&nbsp;<a href=#>Apostolic; Church, Origins, Kinds & Beliefs</a></p><h2><strong>Pros & Cons of Non-Denominational Churches</strong></h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><h2><strong>Pros</strong></h2><p>Non-Denominational churches being independent, can remodel their beliefs and practices to whatever beliefs and doctrine they deem right and righteousness. This gives them the chance to deviate from some traditions of the denominations and interpretations of Christianity.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2><strong>Cons</strong></h2><p>Departing from a vast existing denomination, they can lack resources or influence in the growth of their church and its fellowships. And as the diversity of the church enlarges, misunderstandings and mayhem could mess them up as most of them would have a different theological interpretation of the scripture.</p><h2><strong>What Do Non-denominational Churches Believe?</strong></h2><p>Non-Denominational fellows believe that the Bible is the authority that commands the church and changes their philosophies and beliefs. They are, however, self-governing churches with elders(leaders).</p><h2><strong>Is Baptist A Denomination?</strong></h2><p>According to most scholars around the world, they believe that, Baptists are an English-speaking denomination that was founded in the 17th century Puritanism as a branch of Congregationalism.</p><h2><strong>What’s Denominational Mean?</strong></h2><p>In simple terms, the word Denominational means relating to or organized by a particular religious denomination.</p><ul class=td-pulldown-filter-list></ul><a class="td-social-sharing-button td-social-handler td-social-expand-tabs" href=# data-block-uid=tdi_37 title=More><i class="td-icon-plus td-social-expand-tabs-icon"></i></a><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTBmqqeZpOkunC6zqdknZ2epLqqusCtoKimkaF6pLTUq5qhnaNisrmtzKmjnqtdnL%2Bww9OhZJudnJ6yp7%2BO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ncis-season-11-episode-13-double-back.html><span>←</span><span>NCIS Season 11, Episode 13: Double Back</span></a>
