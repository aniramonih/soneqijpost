Native Americans were said to have given Colonel Ebenezer Sproat, a delegate at a Northwest Territory court session, the name of "Hetuck" — their word for "buckeye" — perhaps because he was, at 6'4", nearly as tall as a tree. It was his nickname the rest of his life, and eventually became adopted by all Ohioans. But no one better deserves the nickname more than Brutus Buckeye —&nbsp; the Ohio State mascot for more than 50 years who basically resembles a humanoid buckeye nut (via <a href=#>Ohio State</a>).</p><p dir=ltr>If you look at Ohio State helmets, you might see yet another emblem of the Buckeye tree, in the form of a sticker bearing the tree's leaf. It's awarded for meritorious on-field performance, so a helmet with a lot of stickers might belong to a particularly formidable player.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCDlHJocGhfpLWqu4ysq5qslah6o8HCpJyynV2irrSvzq1knrCgoa6qusSdZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nmb-new-york.html><span>←</span><span>NMB New York Celeb Secrets</span></a>
