<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Olivia Munn Recalls Near-Death Experience, Talks Aaron Rodgers</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Her story. <strong>Olivia Munn </strong>opened up to <a href=#>Good Housekeeping</a> in its August 2015 cover story about her terrifying brush with death four years ago, and how that experience has made her more open to life and the afterlife.</p><p>“About four years ago, I was almost in a plane crash,” Munn, 35, recalled. “Everybody on the plane thought we were going to die… even the flight attendants were crying and screaming. It made me question everything.”</p><p>Munn (featured in Lionette by Noa Sadé bracelets)&nbsp;received some unconventional help after surviving the incident from Long Island Medium <strong>Theresa Caputo</strong>, who guided her past the fear of the crash. “Theresa helped me open up,” the Newsroom alum dished. “Now I believe in God, or whatever you want to call it. I believe that our souls exist past this – and that as long as we’re good to each other, that’s all that really matters.”</p><p>It’s a principal she regularly applies in <a href=#>her enduring relationship</a> to NFL hunk <strong>Aaron Rodgers</strong>.</p><p>“My boyfriend’s healthiness inspires me,” she gushed of the Green Bay Packers quarterback. “Aaron is different than every other man I’ve ever met…there’s so much I could say. Everything a good person can be, he is. He’s in such great shape, and especially lately, he’s been eating so well and working out. Having somebody in your life like that is so motivating.”</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=400 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Olivia Munn and Aaron Rodgers" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong> broke the news last May</a> that the two were dating, and now, they’ve adopted a puppy together. “Chance made us a family,” she told the mag of her and Rodgers’ pooch. “He and Aaron have changed my life in every way. My world has become so much brighter, sweeter and lovelier. I feel grounded with them in my life.”</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=594 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Olivia Munn Good Housekeeping" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Despite her fondness for the men in her life, Munn was raised to be her own independent woman. “The best advice my mother ever gave me was ‘Never marry a guy and just become somebody’s wife,'” she dished.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“She went to college, and even though she got her degrees, she got married early and never really had the opportunity to find her identity. [She’s a great mom], but she always wanted to do other things, and was never able to. So growing up, my mom always told my sisters and me that you have to be your own person and make a name for yourself. Never settle for being somebody else’s something.”</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=682 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Olivia Munn Good Housekeeping Cover" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The August issue of <a href=#>Good Housekeeping</a> hits newsstands on July 21.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKaloaaerm651KelZqqVmK6tuNJmpZ6ZomKxpq3ToWSesKCav6qxzZycZqyRobi0ecCaqaimXae8pbPEq6pmamBmgnKBlg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brother-coaches-nfl.html><span>←</span><span>NFL Coaches That Are Brothers</span></a>
