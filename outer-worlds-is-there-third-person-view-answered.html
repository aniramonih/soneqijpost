That said, if you were wondering <strong>whether The Outer Worlds features a third-person view or camera</strong>, here’s what you need to know.</p><h2>Is There Third-Person View in The Outer Worlds? Answered</h2><p>To cut straight to the chase, no, there’s no third-person view or camera in The Outer Worlds. The game is played entirely in the first-person perspective, which means that you’ll rarely get an opportunity to see your full character model unless you go to the pause or character menu.</p><p>It’s definitely a little disappointing, as past games in the Fallout and Elder Scroll series have featured a third-person view. While it may seem like a small thing, it was actually a nice feature to have when you weren’t in combat, as it allowed you to look around your character while exploring the larger open world.</p><p>That said, it’s also worth noting that if you leave the game on idle for a minute or two, the game will automatically activate a rotating third-person camera around your character, letting you get a nicer, rounded view of what’s going on around them. It’s not much, and definitely not ideal for players who might have been hoping for a third-person experience in The Outer Worlds, but at least it’s something.</p><p>If Obsidian ever adds this into the game as a post-launch feature, we’ll be sure to let you know, but we wouldn’t hold our breath for that one.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question>Is there a third-person view in The Outer Worlds?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Sadly, no.</p><p>That’s all you need to know about <strong>whether there’s a third-person view or camera in The Outer Worlds</strong>.
