Based on Busy‚Äôs interview, it sounds like they deal with all forms of health, which means I should have been reading all along ‚Äì sorry Health.

The Bulls and Dwyane Wade reached a buyout agreement, ending the 12-time All-Star's homecoming tour in Chicago after just one season.&nbsp;Wade, who was set to earn $23.8 million this season, gave about $8 million back to the Bulls and instead&nbsp;signed a deal with the Cleveland Cavaliers for $2.3 million.

First off, congratulations to Emily Deschanel! She just announced (through her rep) that she‚Äôs pregnant and due later this year. The baby-daddy is her husband, David Hornsby, who many know from his role as Rickety Cricket on It‚Äôs Always Sunny In Philadelphia. They were married last year and they seem genuinely happy together. I always enjoy Emily because A) She‚Äôs not a famewhore, and I get the impression that she lives a very quiet, very private life and she just happens to be on a hit show and B) I love her on Bones, and I love that she loves being on television, and she‚Äôs not trying to do the movie star thing.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Faribault, MN: Ethan Phetsomphou died Lincoln Elementary School Student</h2><time>Aug 31, 2024</time>
