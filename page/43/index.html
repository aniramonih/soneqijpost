If you'd take the train with me
Uptown, thru the misery
Of ghetto streets in morning light,
It's always night.
Take a window seat, put down your Times,
You can read between the lines,
Just meet the faces that you meet
Beyond the window's pane.And it might begin to teach you
How to give a damn about your fellow man.
And it might begin to teach you
How to give a damn about your fellow man.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>'A Scottish Love Scheme' (2024) date, plot, full cast, preview and is the Hallmark movie worth watch</h2><time>Aug 26, 2024</time>
