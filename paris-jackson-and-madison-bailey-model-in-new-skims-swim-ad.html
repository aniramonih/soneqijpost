So, if you wanted to cover up and use a sarong, if you want to cover your arms, you can, if you want a triangle top or to fully cover your chest, different kind of bottoms — you just pick and choose. It’s like Lego pieces … You can hide the pieces you want to hide and accentuate the ones [you want to accentuate].”</p><p>The first lineup included 19 different silhouettes in several color ways. Every item is available in sizes XXS to 4X and the prices range from $32 to $108.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6Wus7XSZqGam5uovK95wKebZqWRmba0u81mmZqhnJrGbrnOnZylZZmjeq%2Bx1maqpKGdqHq0w8imZJqcXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./paige-spiranac.html><span>←</span><span>Paige Spiranac Is Engaged To Her Baseball Player Fiance Steven Tinoco</span></a>
