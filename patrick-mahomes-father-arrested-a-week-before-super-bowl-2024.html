"driving while intoxicated, third or more," with his bond subsequently set at $10,000.&nbsp;</p><p id=ecn2poJ3RUB data-wc=25>This incident was first brought to light by TMZ, highlighting the recurring legal issues faced by the father of the Kansas City Chiefs' star quarterback.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

Mahomes Sr., a 53-year-old former MLB player, has a documented history of DWI arrests.&nbsp;</p><p id=eGXw9Fx9bhh data-wc=30>A notable instance occurred in 2018, as reported by the Kansas City Star, leading to a guilty plea from Mahomes Sr. and a sentence of 40 days in county jail.&nbsp;</p><p id=e41Miltt41f data-wc=21>Remarkably, he served this sentence over weekends, spanning from February 2019 to February 2020, showcasing the legal consequences of his actions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

Mahomes, aged 28, gears up for an intense showdown in his fourth career Super Bowl, where the Kansas City Chiefs will face off against the San Francisco 49ers.&nbsp;</p><p id=eeI8o5KtsGK data-wc=21>Amidst the preparation for this monumental game, Mahomes Sr. had previously shared insights into his experiences attending his son's playoff games.&nbsp;</p><p id=eK2JCL5vEfJ

show on WFAN Sports Radio in January, Mahomes Sr. humorously remarked on the seating arrangements, suggesting that Taylor, with her considerable means, could likely secure whatever suite she preferred.</p><p id=ewhJdG-KCSG data-wc=32>Despite not sharing a booth with Taylor and Travis' brother, Jason, during the Chiefs' victorious game against the Buffalo Bills last month, Mahomes Sr. recounted spending time with them after the game.&nbsp;</p><p id=emRHcMx78YQ data-wc=30>His interactions revealed a lighter, more personal side to the celebrations, including witnessing the exuberant moment when Jason Kelce famously removed his shirt and leapt into the crowd in jubilation.</p><p id=e1_HxTsWRQf data-wc=27>Mahomes Sr.'s relationship with Travis appears to be one of mutual respect and affection, referring to him as "another son" and praising Taylor for her grounded nature.&nbsp;</p><p id=eg9h7KeBA2G data-wc=28>He recounted his initial meeting with Taylor, highlighting her awareness of his identity and her familiarity with the "Quarterback" series, underscoring her interest in Patrick's career and family.&nbsp;</p><p id=ewg0_I7FTdD3 data-wc=32><strong></strong></p><h2
