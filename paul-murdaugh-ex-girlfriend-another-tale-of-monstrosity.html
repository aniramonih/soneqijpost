According to her, she begged him to stop, but Paul grabbed her by her throat and kept throwing punches at her.&nbsp;</p><p>Morgan didn’t elaborate on when the alleged attack occurred.</p><p>In the bone-chilling interview, she also talked about how Paul allegedly drunkenly crashed his truck after a Christmas party in 2017. Some of his influential family members rushed to the scene and hid guns and beer cans in the vehicle before cops arrived.</p><p>Doughty said she was driving Paul home on Christmas Day when he “aggressively” demanded that he drive his truck, despite being drunk, then lost control and crashed into a ditch.</p><p>She tried calling 911 for help, but Paul allegedly grabbed her cell phone from her and hung it up.</p><p>The Murdaugh family is widely known for covering up crimes. Paul’s parents and grandfather cleaned up the mess at the crash site and scolded Doughty for calling 911.</p><p>The truck crash came roughly two years before Paul allegedly drunkenly crashed a boat that killed his friend, Mallory Beach, in 2019.</p><p><strong>“Murdaughs don’t get told ‘no’ much,”</strong> Doughty says in the documentary. At the time of the boat crash, Paul was charged with three counts of boating under the influence but managed to avoid a manslaughter rap due to his family’s influence and power over the law enforcement agencies.&nbsp;</p><p>Morgan went on to say that Paul was a heavy drinker even before he reached the age where he was legally allowed to drink.&nbsp;</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC8wK6jZqWlp7GiwcahZJ6wXZy2s7jFq6CeppRirq%2B706Gcq2Wklrmmec6fZKannqjBs7vSoquyZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./patrick-wayne-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Patrick Wayne Net Worth</span></a>
