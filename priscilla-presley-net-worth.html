She gained popularity majorly after her marriage with Elvis Presley and her portrayal in “The Naked Gun” and “Dallas.”&nbsp; Priscilla Presley has done immense hard work to earn this net worth. </span><span>After taking a dig into the net worth of Priscilla Presley, let’s have a look at her early life.</span></p><h2>Early Life</h2><p><span>Born as Priscilla Ann Wagner on May 24, 1945, in Brooklyn, New York City, she is the child of Ann and James. Her father was a Navy pilot who lost his life in a plane crash when Priscilla was just six months old. Later, in 1948, her mother, Ann tied the knot with Air Force officer Paul Beaulieu and the family relocated every few years because of her stepfather’s career in the Air Force.</span></p><p><span>She was raised in New Mexico, Connecticut, Maine, and Texas. In 1956, Paul was sent to Germany where Priscilla met her <a href=# rel=noopener>future husband</a>, Elvis Presley, who was serving in the Army during that time.</span></p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p><span>After Priscilla’s divorce lived with Elvis Presley, and she dated Mike Stone until 1975. From 1978 to 1985, she dated Michael Edwards, a model, but their relationship ended after he began behaving inadequately with Lisa Marie.</span></p><p><span>Priscilla was then in a <a href=# rel=noopener>relationship</a> with Marco Garibaldi that lasted 22 years and the two also welcomed a son Navarone together. In 2006, the duo broke up, and from 2006 to 2009, she dated TV executive Nigel Lythgoe. She was also linked to lawyer Robert Kardashian and photographer Terry O’Neill.</span></p><h2>Relationship With Elvis Presley</h2><p><span>Priscilla met Elvis for the first time at a party at his Bad Nauheim home in September 1959. Her parents were not delighted with the idea of a relationship between 24-year-old Elvis and 14-year-old Priscilla, however, Priscilla managed to convince them.</span></p><p><span>On May 1, 1967, Priscilla tied the knot with Elvis in an eight-minute ceremony in Las Vegas and welcomed their daughter Lisa Marie in 1968.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Priscilla-Presley.jpg><p><span>She had an <a href=# rel=noopener>extramarital affair</a> that made her realize that she wasn’t happy both physically and emotionally in her marriage which led to their separation in February 1972. They divorced in October 1973 and Lisa Marie’s custody was shared jointly with them.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Career</h2><p><span>Priscilla started the Bis & Beau clothing boutique with friend/stylist Olivia Bis in 1973 in Los Angeles, which became a favorite of many celebrities such as Cher, Barbra Streisand, and Natalie Wood, but shut in 1976. The next year, Elvis died and she became executor for Lisa Marie.</span></p><p><span>Following the realization that her daughter’s inheritance would be going to Graceland (for maintenance, taxes, and other expenses), she converted Graceland into a renowned tourist attraction and CEO Jack Soden helped her to do that. On June 7, 1982, Graceland opened and became a hit among Elvis fans.</span></p><p><span>Since 2006, <a href=# rel=noopener>the museum</a> has been a National Historic Landmark and over 650,000 visitors go there every year. She was the president and chairwoman of Elvis Presley Enterprises, and the property was worth over $100 million by the time Lisa Marie Presley was old enough to formally inherit it in 1993.</span></p><p><span>Priscilla Presley definitely earned a good amount of money from her business which contributed to her massive net worth. </span><span>Priscilla Presley also earned a lot of her net worth from other business ventures including a line of fragrances and linens, apart from that, she also served as the producer of many films and television projects, that includes 1988’s “Elvis and Me”, 1998’s “Breakfast with Einstein” and “Finding Graceland”, “Agent King.”</span></p><p><span>In 2000, she joined Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer’s board of directors and she was also part of “Dallas” from 1983 to 1988 and landed the cast of all 3 films in “The Naked Gun” franchise, where she portrayed Jane Spencer, the love interest of Leslie Nielsen’s Lt. Frank Drebin.&nbsp; </span><span>Priscilla Presley has earned a net worth of $50 million over the years. <a href=# rel=noopener>Stay tuned</a> to our website to get all the latest news.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpa2dga3xzf46pqaKrk565ra2Mqameq5yaxm66xK1ksKeiqbVw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./paul-rudd.html><span>←</span><span>Paul Rudd</span></a>
