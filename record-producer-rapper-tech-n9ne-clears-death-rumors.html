His father had a job of Police Department (LAPD) and was estranged from the family. So he was brought up his mom who had epilepsy and lupus since she was 18 in a very strict Christian ancestry. Likewise, when Tech was 12 years of age Maude married for the second time with a Muslim named <strong>Abdul Hassan</strong>. The rapper has two half-brothers, <strong>Hakim Khalifah</strong> and <strong>Kiraameen Khalifah</strong>, and one half-sister, <strong>Basimah Khalifah</strong>, from his mother’s second marriage.</p><p>Speaking about his personal life, he married his girlfriend, <strong>Lecoya LeJuene</strong> in 1995. The former has two daughters named, <strong>Alyia</strong> and <strong>Reign</strong> <strong>Yates</strong>; aspiring singers. After a decade old matrimony, the pair started living separately since 2005. Almost ten years later, Tech went to the courts for divorce in 2015 which was only permitted in November 2017.</p><p>The 47-year-old has a net worth of $16 million from his musical career since 1991. All the credits of his high wealth are from studio albums like The Worst (2000), K.O.D (2009) and Strange Reign (2017).<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FPqJuirZ1jsLC5jqucnKeimXqxvs6drJydomK%2ForzPnqlmrJWYtW66mKecZpucmq6zv4ydnJqsmGK%2FtrnOq6po</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./president-tinubu-appoints-ola-olukayode-as-new-efcc-chairman.html><span>←</span><span>President Tinubu appoints Ola Olukayode as new EFCC chairman</span></a>
