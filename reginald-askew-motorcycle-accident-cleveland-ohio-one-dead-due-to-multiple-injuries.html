On July 5, 1944, he was brought into the world by his parents, Herb and Doris Robillard. He received his diploma from Brussels High School in 1962, and on September 23, 1967, he tied the knot with the woman who would become the love of his life, Nancy Watters.</p><p>Reg loved the great outdoors, working as a taxidermist, and riding Harley-Davidson motorcycles. He took pleasure in activities such as hunting, tinkering, collecting stuff, and writing well-detailed instructions with a sharpie on the majority of the goods he owned. He was the first person to bring wild turkeys to the Door County area and was very proud of his orchard, which he tended to for almost 20 years and named Sir Reginald’s Sweet Cherry Orchard.</p><p>He was also the first person to bring wild turkeys to the area. Over the course of more than half a century, he excelled as an exceptionally gifted naval draftsman. He spent the better part of a decade in the National Guard. He will be remembered for the everlasting kindness, creativity, and love that he always displayed. Reg will be greatly missed by his wife, Nancy; his two children, Jody (Jodi) Robillard of Brussels and Kari (Eric) Carper of Sturgeon Bay.</p><p>their four grandchildren, Morgan, Cameron, Reece, and Reggi; their four great-grandchildren, Greyson, Zoey, Danica, and Marissa; his brother, Roderick (Vern) Robillard of Brussels; and his sister-in-law, Sharon Robillard of Brussels. His grandparents, Herb and Doris Robillard, his brother Clyde, his grandson Will, and his in-laws, John and Rosemary Watters, all passed away before he did. His parents were his immediate predecessors in death.</p><p>Funeral Services will be held at Salem Lutheran Church on Wednesday, October 11, 2023 at 11 a.m., and Reverend Tod Vertz will preside over the ceremony. On Tuesday, visitation will take place at the Forbes Funeral Home from 4:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m., and on Wednesday, visitation will take place at the church beginning at 10:00 a.m. and continuing until the time of the services.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwvsSgoKeZnJl6or%2FKnq5mpZ%2BpvLOv2JyjnmWRmLCqsMSnq2abnJrDprjAp5tmp5ievG67zZ5knZ2RmXqlwcRmq6hlnaq5tbXPpZxmoZ6fwrO1xKxm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./patokh-chodiev-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Patokh Chodiev Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
