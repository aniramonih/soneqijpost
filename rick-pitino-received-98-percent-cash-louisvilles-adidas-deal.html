The current deal, which expires July 1, is supposed to help student-athletes perform better with top-of-the-line equipment and gear. 
Turns out, almost all of the money from this current deal is going to Rick Pitino, the now-suspended head coach.
Pitino took home a whopping 98 percent of what Louisville has been receiving, according to contracts obtained by the Louisville Courier-Journal under Kentucky's public records act."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The rest of the money – a paltry $25,000 in comparison – went to the actual athletic program.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The year before, it was even worse: Pitino again netted $1.5 million, while just $10,000 went to the athletic department.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Under both the existing contract and the new one, money that goes from Adidas to Louisville coaches under these personal service agreements is taken from the overall funds provided to the athletic program. Adidas also gives apparel, shoes, and scholarships for an internship program.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Kenny Klein, the spokesman for Louisville's athletic department, argued the money going to Pitino was actually beneficial to student-athletes. Klein said that players come to Louisville in part because of Pitino, and added the coach already had a contract with Adidas before the program signed a deal with the company.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Of course, that was all said before the bribery scandal of last month. Might there be even more money that's been exchanged?</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The new contract calls for about $79 million in cash to go to the Louisville program, in addition to shoes and other apparel. Details of the deal aren't public, so it's not yet known how much would go to coaches.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>That cash </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>isn't </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>going to players, though. The NCAA's stance has consistently been that it can't – or won't – pay its players. To see so much money going into a coach's pocket isn't a good look.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjqugnKNdpba1tc2oZKudk5q2t7HDZnBxZaCav6Sxza1knJmjnXqtu9Siqq%2BhnKGytHnAnaCdmaNisaaty2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./reed-howard-wikipedia-biography-age-height-instagram-wife-net-worth-family-html.html><span>←</span><span>Reed Howard Wikipedia, Biography, Age, Height, Instagram, Wife, Net Worth, Family</span></a>
