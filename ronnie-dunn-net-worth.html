Ronnie Dunn accumulated his net worth through his singing and songwriting career as a solo artist and duo, musical tours, and as a duo have sold over 30 million records. Ronnie Dunn was born June 1, 1953 in Coleman, Texas and attended 13 schools in his first 12 years of school. He began school in New Mexico and finished his formal education at Abilene Christian University in 1975 as a psychology major. When he began playing bass guitar and singing with bands in clubs in the Abilene, Texas, area, the university gave him the choice of either quitting the band or the university. He chose to leave the university and moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma, for a chance at the country music scene.</p><p>He lived there for many years while drawing much inspiration from local honky tonks such as Tulsa City Limits, which is prominently featured in the music video for Brooks & Dunn's hit "Boot Scootin' Boogie". In 1990, he and <a href=# title="Kix Brooks Net Worth">Kix Brooks</a> formed Brooks & Dunn. Brooks & Dunn released 12 studio albums, two greatest hits albums, and a Christmas album. Brooks & Dunn sold over 30 million records, had 20 number one singles on Billboard, and were one of the most consistently successful acts on the concert circuit. In 2009, they announced that they would disband in 2010.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70aiapGWjqa6zv46rpqemmZp6pcHNp2SnnaRixLC%2B06Fm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./where-is-gail-katzs-husband-robert-bierenbaum-now.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Robert Bierenbaum: Where is Gail Katzs Husband Now?</span></a>
