On September 11, 1999, they married.</p><p style=text-align:justify>A year later, their son Armand was born, followed by a daughter, Lena, two years later. Rosemarie was hailed as an incredibly caring mother by her relatives, and the pair appeared to be content and planned for a third child.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.current-affairs.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Yazeed-Essa-min-300x223.jpg><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Rosemarie_Essa_Murder_Case_Details></span>Rosemarie Essa Murder Case Details<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul style=text-align:justify><li>Yazeed Essa was a successful young doctor when he met and married Rosemarie “Rosie” DiPuccio, a nurse.

McGregor assumed Essa’s husband tampered with the pills and confronted him at the burial.</p><p style=text-align:justify>McGregor later notified a colleague nurse, Christine DiCillo, who called the cops, who had already launched an investigation into Essa’s death as suspicious.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Relatives also reported that Yazeed was acting oddly after his wife died. Instead of accepting family help, he hired two nannies, Marguerita Montenaz and Michele Madeline.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.current-affairs.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Yazeed-Essa-min-1-300x253.jpg><p style=text-align:justify>Detective Gary McKee, one of the case’s investigators, eventually determined that Yazeed was having an affair with both women.</p><p style=text-align:justify>If you’re looking for a unique way to express yourself, this is the place to be. Yazeed stated why he had provided calcium pills to Essa, stating, “I was at my mother’s place two weeks ago, and I was thinking about this as well. My mother had this older woman around, and they were discussing osteoporosis and such. And I’d been informed that because Rosie was there, we should definitely start taking calcium pills because she’s over 35.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>McKee asked for the drugs, and Yazeed obliged. Yazeed planned a going-away party that day before calling his sister Runa at 4 a.m. to ask if she could watch the kids, alleging that a friend out-of-state had been in an accident. Then, Yazeed vanished.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Four weeks after Essa’s death, a toxicology analysis revealed that the calcium pills she was given contained potassium cyanide, validating police and the DiPuccios’ suspicions.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The local cops then contacted the FBI, who assigned Phil Torsney to find Yazeed.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Rosemarie_Essa_Why_Her_Husband_Murdered_Her></span>Rosemarie Essa: Why Her Husband Murdered Her?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p style=text-align:justify>Rosemarie Essa’s family was initially taken aback by the loss of their young and healthy daughter and suspected nothing nefarious.</p><p style=text-align:justify>However, it wasn’t until one of her closest friends, Eva McGregor, made contact with Rosie’s brother, Dominic DiPuccio, that the family realized something was wrong.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Rosie was driving to see a last-minute movie with her sister, Deanna, on that fateful afternoon in February 2005, when she began to feel ill behind the wheel.</p><p style=text-align:justify>According to Eva, Rosie contacted her to say she wasn’t feeling well and felt her husband, Yaz, was to blame. “She (Eva) proceeded to tell me that Rosie was talking to her on her way to the movie, and she said Yaz had given her a calcium pill before she left the house, and she began to feel nauseated,” Dominic explained.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Rosie had intended to call and confront Yaz, but she lost control of the car before she could do so, according to Eva.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.current-affairs.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Yazeed-Essa-min-3-300x246.jpg><p style=text-align:justify>Eva told the story to Rosie’s other brother, Rocky, as well, and Dominic, a lawyer by trade, was wary. They agreed to contact the coroner and ask for a more detailed report on their sister’s death.</p><p style=text-align:justify>But Eva had discussed her concerns with her neighbor, Christine DiCillo, who worked with Rosie and Yaz at the hospital. She reported the incident to the Highland Heights police department, and Yaz was questioned on March 17, 2005.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Yaz was chilly during the interview, implying that he made Rosie take the calcium pills after overhearing his mother discussing osteoporosis. He even took officers to his home and handed over the bottle of calcium pills and other prescription that his wife consumed.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Yaz hosted a party that night and contacted Deanna about 4 a.m. to watch his kids for the weekend. He claimed that he needed to go to North Carolina to help a close friend’s brother who had been in an accident.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Yaz’s bottle of calcium pills was found to be poisoned with cyanide when police tested it. Yaz, on the other hand, had departed the nation by then, eventually finding his way to Beruit, Lebanon, and adopting the moniker Maurice Khalife.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Because the United States and Lebanon did not have an extradition treaty, Yaz was practically untouchable by American authorities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.current-affairs.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Yazeed-Essa-min-2-300x240.jpg><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Rosemarie_Essa_Current_Location></span>Rosemarie Essa: Current Location<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p style=text-align:justify>Yaz lived a wealthy and glamorous life in Lebanon for 17 months as the FBI waited for him to make a mistake. According to the show, the fugitive doctor had become overconfident by this point, and he publicly boasted about murdering his wife and eluding American law enforcement officers.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Yaz boarded a plane to Cyprus under a false identity on October 7, 2006, but was apprehended by officials who were waiting for him. The FBI had knowledge about this travel and contacted the Cyprus authorities before Yaz’s plane landed.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Cyprus and the United States had an extradition pact, although it no longer applied to cases involving the death sentence. Yaz’s lawyers opposed the extradition vehemently, and American law enforcement officials had to emphasize that the death penalty was not involved before they were finally able to extradite him to Cleveland three years later, in early January 2009.</p><p style=text-align:justify>His trial began in January 2010, when jurors found that Yaz was a philanderer who had been accused of theft and record tampering, and who had even had his license suspended and reinstated on probation.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Eva also testified that Yaz supposedly gave Rosie herpes, and other witnesses remarked on how carefree and casual he appeared after his wife died, cracking jokes and throwing parties.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Yaz was convicted of aggravated murder in March 2010 and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for 20 years.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The Ohio Supreme Court refused his appeal in November 2011, while he was completing his sentence at the Ohio State Penitentiary in Youngstown. According to his inmate records, his first parole hearing will not be held until November 2028.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Read More:&nbsp;<a href=#>Magpie Murders PBS Cast, Release Date, Time and more</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pMHRq5ynrF2Ws6etyKuqZ6einHyzu9KepJqqmZp6pr%2FSmmSmraKZsrN5yKdknZmkmrmqusRmqp6boprBtHnUp5qorpWnsqV7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./172307-pretoria-woman-turns-heads-coworkers-office-outfits-video-sparks-admiration-mzansi.html><span>←</span><span>Pretoria Woman Turns Heads With Coworkers' Office Outfits, Video Sparks Admiration Across Mzansi</span></a>
