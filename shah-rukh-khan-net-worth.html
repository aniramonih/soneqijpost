I feel very close to them I think friends are everything in life after your family. You come across lots of people all the time but you only make very few friends and you have to be true to them otherwise what’s the point in life?”&nbsp;</p><p>“When I think back on it, of course, I got lucky and got great directors and good breaks but all that was the physical part. But what made me a star was that I could take a chance and not have anything to worry about in terms of losing.”&nbsp;</p><p>“I think the way the audience takes the Indian film star is a little different from the way the audience takes the Western star there. We are considered like demi-gods here, and the reason is not that we are better or good, but because there is no other mode of entertainment in India.”<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“Yes I have made a lot of money and I have a lot of respect, my films have done well, and I know there are loads of loads of people who look up to me and really love me. I really just thought this is like a strange dream. I have never thought this is a success – I don’t have a standard.”</p><p><strong>Read more :</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>American Youtuber Logan Paul Net Worth 2022: Here’s What We Know!</a></li><li><a href=#>Patrick Bet-David</a> Net Worth 2022, How Does Patrick Bet-David<a href=#> Make His Money?</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfo7K1edaoqa2gX6i1orSMq6ykoF2gtaK6jKecrWWnpL%2B1tI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sean-caracena-from-kid-90-who-is-he.html><span>←</span><span>Sean Caracena From Kid 90: Who Is He?</span></a>
