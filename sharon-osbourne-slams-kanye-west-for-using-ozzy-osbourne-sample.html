I WANT NO ASSOCIATION WITH THIS MAN!”</p><p>West had a release party in Chicago for his and <strong>Ty Dolla Sign</strong>’s joint album Vultures on Thursday, February 8. The record was expected to drop on Friday but has yet to hit streaming services at this time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Kanye-West-%E2%80%98Sincerely-Apologizes-For-His-Antisemitic-Comments-in-New-Note-Written-In-Hebrew-1.jpg><p>Before the album’s release, West has been dealing with the backlash over his <a href=#>numerous antisemitic comments</a> over the years. In October 2022, West tweeted he was going “death con 3 [sic] on JEWISH PEOPLE.”</p><p>His comment led to him getting <a href=#>banned from the platform</a> and losing several sponsorships. West then appeared on Piers Morgan Uncensored to apologize for his remarks. Two months later, West sat down with <strong>Alex Jones</strong> where he stated he saw “<a href=#>good things about Hitler</a>.”</p><p>Most recently, West went on a rant in December 2023 where he claimed that “Zionists” control private schools and hospitals, adding that “it’s 60 million of us in America, 60 million Jews in the world.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Days later, West took to social media to <a href=#>apologize again</a> with a message written in Hebrew.</p><p>“I sincerely apologize to the Jewish community for any ‘unintended outburst’ caused by my words or actions,’” he said at the time. “[It] was not my intention to hurt or demean, and I deeply regret any pain I may have caused. I am committed to starting with myself and learning from this experience to ensure greater sensitivity and understanding in the future.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqhmaKku2670pumrqqemnq0uMCmqmajkaPGpnnWnqqtZZakv27B0qKloGWfr8e6ec6smaitoqOybr%2FApqelnV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sandy-molling-net-worth-income-salary-html.html><span>←</span><span>Sandy Mlling Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
