They’ve learned to create strength and happiness from dark places,” is a quote Stacey shared via his Instagram stories.</p><p>The 25-year-old did not directly address his famous girlfriend’s current family troubles, nor did he even mention her name. Fans though, are assuming he is talking about Simone.</p><p>He shared the quote hours after news broke Tevin was taken into custody for being the alleged shooter at a New Year’s Eve party on December 31, 2018. The incident resulted in Devaughn Gibson age 23, Toshaun Banks age 21, and Delvante Johnson age 19 losing their lives. Several other people were injured in the shooting, which took place at an Airbnb in Cleveland.</p><p>The decorated Olympian has been dating Stacey for over two years. They made their first public appearance together when Simone was inducted into USA Gymnastics Hall of Fame.</p><p>“Words cannot express how incredibly proud I am of you, all you’ve accomplished & how well you carry yourself. You make me feel like I am the luckiest man alive. Congratulations on your induction to the USA Gymnastics Hall of Fame! I can’t wait to see what the future has in store,” Stacey shared in one of their first Instagram photos together at the induction.</p><p>Simone gushed over her man hours before her family life became national news.</p><p>“Missing you a lil extra today,” the gold medal winner said along with a photo of her and her main man.</p><p>Stacey Ervin Jr. has alluded to the arrest of girlfriend Simone Biles’ older brother Tevin Biles-Thomas. The gymnast has not spoken out publicly regarding what legal trouble her brother is in. She did Tweet that she was eating her feelings after the news broke.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Thankfully Simone has Stacey to help her through this challenging time. Not only is her brother’s legal trouble making headlines, but she is gearing up for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. Looks like she will have her loving boyfriend by her side through the thick of it all.</p><span><a href=# rel=prev><img width=150 height=27 alt="Next Article" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></span><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGejnrqwusRmmaKklah6o7vYn6minZ6ZerTAwJycsmWVp8OquoyjqWaZnKHCpbHSZquoZZiav26u0airoZ2iYsGmwsinqmaZoqeytMCMbGhvbWRqfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rhoa-recap-sheree-whitfield-martell-holt-cheating.html><span>←</span><span>Sheree Whitfields Boyfriend Martell Holt May Be Cheating Hollywood Life</span></a>
