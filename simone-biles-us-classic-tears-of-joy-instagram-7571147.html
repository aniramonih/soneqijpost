Those marks earned her first place in the all-around competition, the vault, floor routine, and balance beam. She came in third place on the uneven bars.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Stacy Revere/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Tears of joy as I make this comeback, surrounded by the love you‚Äôve shown! thank you for believing in me ü´∂üèæ," she wrote&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>on Instagram</a>&nbsp;Sunday evening after the event wrapped up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jonathan Owens, Biles's husband and NFL safety, showed his support with a super-sweet comment on the post, writing, "So damn proud of you baby ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Makes my day seeing you so happy and back doing what you love, and having FUN!!! I love you so much." Like all of us, it seems like Owens was elated to see Biles back in the game and taking the first steps to get to the 2024 Paris Olympics.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Stacy Revere/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It felt really good, especially after everything that's happened over the past year," Biles&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told NBC after the competition</a>, referencing her mental blocks and her struggles with the "twisties" back in 2021.

"My main goal was this, and then championships. And then after that, we'll look onto World, and then we'll see, but so far it's heading in the right direction.
