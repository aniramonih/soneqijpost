<span>Tandra Barner</span></p><h1>Sons Of Anarchy Ending Explained, Does Jax Die At The End Of Sons Of Anarchy? The Talks Today</h1></header><section class=post-content><h2 id=sons_of_anarchy_ class=smooth-goto>Sons of Anarchy</h2><p>Sons of Anarchy is a crime drama TV series created by Kurt Sutter for FX, which aired from September 2008 to December 2014. The show revolves around the lives of a tight-knit outlaw motorcycle club in the fictional town of Charming located in the Central Valley of California. Charlie Hunnam plays Jax Teller, who starts as the club’s vice president and later becomes its president. The discovery of a manifesto written by his late father, who previously led the club, makes Jax question himself, his relationships, and the club. The show explores themes of love, brotherhood, loyalty, betrayal, and redemption, while delving into topics such as vigilantism, government corruption, and racism. Sons of Anarchy used the outlaw motorcycle club as an allegory for personal transformation. David Labrava, a real-life member of the Oakland chapter of Hells Angels, provided technical advice and portrayed Happy Lowman, the club’s assassin, in the series.</p><h2 id=sons_of_anarchy_ending_explained class=smooth-goto>Sons Of Anarchy ending explained</h2><p>In 2014, Sons of Anarchy, FX’s popular crime drama series, concluded after a seven-season, 92-episode run. Throughout the show, Jax Teller (played by Charlie Hunnam) and the motorcycle club faced numerous challenges, leading to a violent and tumultuous journey. Despite this, series creator Kurt Sutter was able to bring the story to a close in the manner he intended, which is not always the case for TV shows. Not every character had a happy ending, as the team made sure to provide closure for each storyline in various ways, including the use of extreme violence, as well as bringing the narrative full circle. While the show’s action-heavy episodes kept the audience engaged, season 7 provided a significant focus on Jax’s character development as he struggled to cope with the aftermath of Tara’s (Maggie Siff) death in season 6. The season explored Jax’s journey as he tried to find a way to break free from the cycle of violence that had plagued his life and prevent his sons from facing a similar fate. Additionally, he attempted to restore some good in the world and take the motorcycle club down a new path.</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Nv9YrZr3wE</p><h2 id=does_jax_die_at_the_end_of_sons_of_anarchy_ class=smooth-goto>Does Jax die at the end of Sons of Anarchy?</h2><p>During the quarantine period, Kurt Sutter engaged with fans on social media and answered various questions about Sons of Anarchy. One fan asked about the main reasons behind Jax’s decision to end his life, and Sutter suggested that it was due to Jax not being able to live without his wife Tara, who was killed by his mother Gemma in season 6. Tara’s death triggered Jax’s character arc, leading him to prioritise revenge. However, due to Gemma’s lies, he ended up killing innocent people and damaging SAMCRO’s relationships with other characters and clubs. According to Sutter, many factors contributed to Jax’s decision, but ultimately, it was about ending the lineage of Tellers being associated with the outlaw life, so his sons would not follow in his footsteps.</p><p>Executive producer Paris Barclay explained in a 2014 interview with EW that the show was always intended to be a tragedy in the Shakespearean or Greek sense. The series was heading toward its tragic end, and the creators always knew that Jax would not have a happy ending with his sons. It’s worth noting that Sons of Anarchy was inspired by William Shakespeare’s Hamlet, with Jax representing Hamlet himself. Barclay also referenced this when explaining that in tragedies, the hero usually dies.</p><h2 id=son_of_anarchy_plot class=smooth-goto>Son of Anarchy Plot</h2><p>Each season of Sons of Anarchy features interconnected storylines that revolve around the personal and familial life of Jackson “Jax” Teller (played by Charlie Hunnam) and the Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club, Redwood Original (SAMCRO), the dominant chapter of the club based in Charming, California. SAMCRO is heavily involved in the illegal gun trade in the western US and constantly deals with rival gangs, politicians, and law enforcement. Jax, who starts as SAMCRO’s vice president and later becomes its president, struggles to manage the club and the legacy of his late father, John Teller, who founded the organization. Jax’s stepfather, Clay Morrow, takes over SAMCRO after John’s death and is also married to Jax’s mother and John’s widow, Gemma Teller Morrow. Jax’s complicated relationships with his high school sweetheart, Tara Knowles, and his childhood best friend, Opie Winston, also play a significant role in the series. The show draws inspiration from the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club and features guest appearances by real-life Hells Angels members, including David Labrava, Chuck Zito, Rusty Coones, and Sonny Barger.</p><h2 id=about_sons_of_anarchy_ class=smooth-goto>About Sons of Anarchy</h2><table cellspacing=0><tbody readability=6><tr><td><strong>SPECIFICATIONS&nbsp;</strong></td><td><strong>DETAILS&nbsp;</strong></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Genre</td><td>Serial drama<p>Action</p><p>Crime drama</p><p>Tragedy</p><p>Neo-Western</p></td></tr><tr><td>Created by</td><td>Kurt Sutter</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Theme music composer</td><td>Bob Thiele Jr.<p>Dave Kushner</p><p>Curtis Stigers</p></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Opening theme</td><td>“This Life” by Curtis Stigers & The Forest Rangers</td></tr><tr><td>Composer</td><td>Bob Thiele Jr.</td></tr><tr><td>Country of origin</td><td>United States</td></tr><tr><td>Original language</td><td>English</td></tr><tr><td>No. of seasons</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>No. of episodes</td><td>92&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Cinematography</td><td>Paul Maibaum</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Editors</td><td>Paul Fontaine<p>Etienne des Lauriers</p><p>Lauren Pendergrass</p></td></tr><tr><td>Distributor</td><td>20th Television</td></tr><tr><td>Original network</td><td>FX</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Original release</td><td>September 3, 2008 – December 9, 2014</td></tr></tbody></table><p><i>Disclaimer</i>: The above information is for general informational purposes only.
