Another <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wondered</a>, "Anyone else like their sick voice? Because I'm over here falling in love with mine. Please let this be like when Sophia Bush's voice changed PLEASE."</p><p>Sophia has a response for the social media users who tag her in this type of post, one she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> out back in May 2019. "As cute as it is to be tagged in tweets like this," she began, "for the one millionth time: I'm not sick. Nothing is wrong with my throat or my vocal cords. I actually like my voice." "If it irks you so much, sorry not sorry," she continued. "Don't tag me when you complain about it. Kthanksbye."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>As cute as it is to be tagged it tweets like this, for the one millionth time:</p><p>I‚Äôm not sick.

"I love my voice," she said. "I've sounded like this since, I think, second grade. It's just how I talk. No, I'm not sick. No, I don't have a cold. I will take your Ricolas, but I don't particularly need them."</p><p>"I think that there's a beauty in self-acceptance and in owning whatever it is you are," she went on. "And I was made this way. My voice sounds like this. Why would I want to change it?"</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">These days, Sophia Bush is committed to using her voice for the greater good.</h2><p>"I'm not going to let some angry, faceless hater sitting behind a keyboard silence me or prevent me from speaking my opinions or defending people who deserve it," Sophia continued in her piece for Today.</p><p>Back then, she was "taking constitutional law." "The way that our legal system works is very exciting to me," she said at the time.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Work in Progress (@workinprogress)</a></p></figure><p>And now, she's using not only her literal voice ‚Äî but also her social media platforms ‚Äî to educate, inform, and reach her massive following (she has nearly 4 million followers on Instagram alone). Whether she's posting highlights about human trafficking, detailing her July 2021 COVID scare, or speaking out on Texas's abortion ban, there is always something to learn on Sophia's Instagram account.</p><p>The Good Sam star has even expanded her reach by starting her own podcast two years ago, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Work in Progress</a>, where she explores "the personal, professional, and sometimes political lives of some of society and culture's most fascinating people." She's hosted such diverse guests as lawyer Anita Hill, former Stockton, Calif. Mayor Michael Tubbs, and actress Connie Britton.</p><p>It's refreshing to see someone in Hollywood use their voice, both literally and figuratively, to so generously impact her huge audience.
