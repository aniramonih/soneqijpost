On Monday (March 6), Madlib took to Instagram to share the new music with fans, writing, “OUT NOW!!!” in the post’s caption.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Aside from the Black Star rapper, Madlib revealed that several other artists appear on the album, including Roy Ayers, Q-Tip, and Westside Gunn, and there’s also a posthumous feature from Mac Miller.</p><p>“Liberation 2 produced entirely by @madlib and recorded around the globe with features from @mynameisdiani @amani.aint.here @casspernyovest @bigbirdkuti @jdawildchild @qtiptheabstract @westsidegunn @rocmarci @officialmeshell @royayerssunshine @goapele @pinksiifu @jessicacaremoor @moonbyrdmusic @macmiller,” he wrote.</p><p><a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>The pair announced to fans that the project would be released last month</a>. In a press release, Talib revealed that he and Madlib had worked on the album for over a decade.</p><p>“This album was written, recorded and mixed over 10 years,” he said. “It’s expansive in concept but tight in its substance and approach. People today are taking stock of what is most important – family, health, wellness, love.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Talib continued: “The materialism and debauchery that is stereotypically associated with Hip Hop has lost some of its luster,” he continued. “Madlib and I have been consistent in our messaging. Never has there been a better time for such honest, message-driven music that pays tribute to the sounds that came before us.”</p><p>Ahead of the project’s release, the pair dropped their first single off the project. “After These Messages” featuring Talib’s son, Amani.</p><p>Talib Kweli and Madlib’s working relationship has been well documented. The iconic wordsmith teamed up with his Black Star group mate, Yasiin Bey (formerly Mos Def), and the prolific beat wizard to perform a track titled, “Mineral Mountain,” from their 2022 album No Fear Of Time&nbsp;on Saturday Night Live.</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/02/DX_NewMusicFriday_Single-FEB-10TH-250x142.png alt="New Music Friday: New Singles From NAV, Lizzo & SZA, Central Cee, Babyface Ray & More" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>New Music Friday: New Singles From NAV, Lizzo & SZA, Central Cee, Babyface Ray & More</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>February 10, 2023</p></a><p><a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>Joining them was legendary Roots MC Black Thought</a>, who dropped some bars over a psychedelic, hard-hitting backdrop.</p><p>“My history, what can I say? It ain’t perfect/ It ain’t on Wikipedia, you can’t search it/ The thing about graffiti is it ain’t cursive/ If it don’t make you feel a way it ain’t worth it,” Black Thought rapped before namedropping Common, Tesla and the late, great J Dilla.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Any fan of either Black Star or Black Thought will know their roots run deep. Aside from their Soulquarians affiliation, the trio teamed up on the Pete Rock-produced “Flying High” remix of Mos and Kweli’s “Respiration” in 1999.</p><p>Black Thought also shared the mic with Mos Def on The Roots’ “Double Trouble,” “Rising Down” and “The Hurricane,” while trading rhymes with Talib Kweli on songs such as “Guerrilla Monsoon Rap,” “Rolling With Heat” and “I Will Not Apologize.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mirmqSZl3qsw8SloGalkZm5qq6MmqObrZ1iuaquxKuYraGfo3pzecuupKKmkafG</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./clara-felicia.html><span>←</span><span>Swedish Model Clara Felicia Is Still Single!!!
