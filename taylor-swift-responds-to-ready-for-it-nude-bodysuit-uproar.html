At one point, the numbers 89 and 91 are spray-painted on the wall behind the singer, who is known for including Easter eggs in her videos. Fans were quick to point out that the numerals are likely a nod to Swift and her boyfriend <a href=#><strong>Joe Alwyn</strong></a>‘s birth years. After all, one of the lyrics in “…Ready for It?” references someone “younger than my exes,” whom many fans believe to be the 26-year-old actor.</p><p>“…Ready for It?” was the second track released from the pop star’s upcoming sixth album, Reputation (out November 10). She has also released lead single “Look What You Made Me Do” and the love song “Gorgeous.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatmamhvLN50rCgn6xdp7K0vM6nm6xlpKR6s7HAnbBmnp%2BneqrAjKesnZ1dl7ylxdKuoK1lpaW%2FsK3RaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sydney-mclaughlin-parents-biography-age-net-worth-boyfriend.html><span>←</span><span>Sydney McLaughlin Parents, Biography, Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend</span></a>
