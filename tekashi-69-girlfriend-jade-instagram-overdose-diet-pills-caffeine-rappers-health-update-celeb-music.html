The ‘Trollz’ hitmaker had earlier confirmed to the Instagram gossip page, The Shade Room, shortly after the incident that he was fine and was trying to lose weight when he overdosed on diet pills and caffeine. The Shade Room had reported that Tekashi told them he was only taking Hydroxycut and not drugs not just because he doesn’t do drugs but owing to his strict probation that would send him right back to jail. The artiste added that he had gained a lot of weight after he left prison and was over 200 lbs at one point. It is reported that the rapper now weighs 177 lbs and plans to continue to shed his weight until he reaches 150 lbs before he returns to Instagram.</p><p>However, Vulture reported that Tekashi 69’s lawyer has denied the overdose report. His lawyer, Lance Lazarro, told Vulture, “He did not overdose. He was treated and released on the same day. And when asked if he could confirm if 6ix9ine’s treatment was for mixing Hydroxycut with caffeine, Lazzaro asserted, “That I cannot.” As of now, the rapper has completely isolated himself from social media and has also not been spotted in the public eye since the much-discussed incident.</p><p>According to AllHipHop, the 24-year-old’s long-time girlfriend, Jade, has now shared an indirect update on the rapper’s health with the help of a montage of heartwarming photos and videos featuring the duo on her Instagram stories. According to the publication The Blast, the video was made by a fan account which she shared on her page. She did not post a caption on the montage and it is being assumed by the fans that the rapper’s health might be slightly better. Some of the clips feature them making out, their personal life photos, and even behind the scenes at his video shoots.</p><p>Tekashi 6ix9ine began dating Jade, who goes by the username of ‘OhSoYouJade’ on Instagram, just a few weeks before heading to prison on racketeering charges at the end of 2018, as reported by the publication CapitalXtra. The artiste apparently shelled out $35,000 on a watch for her birthday.</p><p>Jade has often expressed her love for Tekashi 69 and she even posted a lot of pics of herself when she visited him in jail. The rapper returned the favor when he also gave a heartfelt shout out to Jade via his Instagram account. While sharing a pic of his girlfriend visiting him during his time in jail, he wrote, “You was there when nobody wasn't. You stuck by me at my lowest. For the people who think any different I do love you and for ever will! You are my world!! [sic].” Jade, whose real name is Rachel Wattley, is often spotted wearing a long, rainbow-colored wig in honor of her rapper boyfriend who is equally famous for his colorful locks. Jade also has a large 69 tattoo on her collarbone.</p><p>CapitalXtra reports that Jade, who used to work as a bartender with her sister, Baddie Gi, at a strip club in New York, first made headlines when she got involved in a scuffle at the bar with rapper Cardi B. It is rumored that Cardi B ordered an attack on her as she suspected that Jade was having an affair with her partner, Offset. The ‘Bodak Yellow’ hitmaker was then arrested and indicted on 14 charges, including felony assault with intent to cause serious physical injury, however, she later pleaded not guilty on all charges. It all started when Jade had shared the footage in December 2019 showing that Offset had sent her a flirty text to which both Cardi B and Offset denied and claimed that his account was hacked.</p><p>According to gossip site, The Blast, it is also rumored that Jade and Tekashi 69 might be engaged as she was recently spotted trying on diamond rings. In August 2020, Jade revealed that she is pregnant with the rapper’s baby. Apart from her girlfriend duties, Jade was also seen in Nicki Minaj’s ‘Good Form’ music video.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRorJWgrrS0yGZtcmWXnr%2BtstGinKecXZ%2BupbGMoqWsrJGcv6K5jKitnqqUpMCmecOinK1loJ65rb%2BMnJifnpWeu6Z50ZqnqZ2iqHqpscClq6FlpaWxosDEZpqepJWXeq7B0qKa</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-laura-dern-dating-ex-husband-ben-harper-rapper-common-actress-linked-bradley-cooper-533563.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Laura Dern dating?
