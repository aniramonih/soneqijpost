<span>Billy Koelling</span></p><h1>Teresa Terry: The Untold Story of Todd Chrisley's First Wife</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Viewers of the USA Network reality TV show “Chrisley Knows Best” might not be familiar with Teresa Terry, the first wife of the reality show’s main character, Todd Chisley. Before becoming the star of the USA Network’s show which premiered in 2014, Todd made a living as a businessman and real estate tycoon.</p><p>Todd and his current wife, Julie, continue to dominate headlines after being found guilty of fraud and tax evasion. However, the reality TV star’s mysterious first wife intrigues fans. Although Teresa Terry shies away from the spotlight, she accused Todd of physical and mental abuse throughout their short-lived marriage. Consequently, fans are curious about what transpired between the “Chrisley Knows Best” star and his first wife.</p><p>Here’s what we know about Todd Chrisley’s first wife.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-07-28_02-24-22-fotor-2023072823144.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Todd_Chrisleys_First_Wife></span>Who Is Todd Chrisley’s First Wife?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Teresa Terry was born in South Carolina, United States, in 1971. Due to her private lifestyle, her exact birthdate and the identity of her parents and siblings are unknown. However, she is of American nationality and White Caucasian ethnicity. Since Terry is not a celebrity, there are no details regarding her life before she crossed paths with her ex-husband.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-08-21_05-12-35-fotor-2023082151730.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=When_Did_Teresa_Terry_and_Todd_Chrisley_meet></span>When Did Teresa Terry and Todd Chrisley meet?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Terry and Todd met in high school when she was seventeen. Todd, on the other hand, was nineteen when they first met. Although there are no details about when they started dating, the then-couple dated throughout high school. However, things became serious when Teresa Terry became pregnant with their first child at 19. Due to the pregnancy, Todd and his first wife tied the knot.</p><p>After giving birth to their first child, a girl, Lindsie Chrisley, the young couple welcomed their second child and son, Kyle Chrisley, fifteen months later. In a 2014 interview, Terry described their early marriage in the late ’80s as “very Southern and laid back.” The then-young parents enjoyed going to the movies, having family meals, and hanging out.&nbsp;</p><p>However, as time passed, their marriage became pockmarked with claims of domestic abuse and controlling behavior. According to Todd Chrisley’s first wife, they separated multiple times during their seven years of marriage. She claimed she filed a domestic abuse complaint against Todd in 1992 after he “battered” her. However, Todd denied every allegation, and she eventually dropped the domestic violence case amid their divorce.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=When_Did_Teresa_Terry_Divorce_Her_Ex-husband></span>When Did Teresa Terry Divorce Her Ex-husband?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Teresa Terry divorced the reality TV star after seven years of marriage. She alleged that her ex-husband was controlling and physically violent and that she feared for her life. While one would think the divorce would end their chapter together, the former couple went in and out of the courtroom multiple times.&nbsp;</p><p>Terry filed a criminal complaint against Todd alleging “Unlawful abduction” after she claimed the real estate mogul “wouldn’t let” her have her daughter, Lindsie, when she went to pick her up from her paternal grandparent’s house. Like with the physical violence accusations, Terry’s ex-husband denied the allegation.</p><p>Consequently, the court granted the former couple joint legal and physical custody of their two children during their divorce agreement. However, after relocating to Atlanta, Todd reopened the custody case, leading to a ruling that was more in his favor. Although the second custody battle granted joint custody, the children started attending school in Atlanta.</p><p>Consequently, Teresa Terry, who lived in South Carolina, saw her kids less. Afterward, Todd went after his ex-wife again in 2012. The reality TV star tried to get one over Terry with a failed $1 million child support suit. Although the battles are over, Todd Chrisley’s first wife labels her marriage as a “wild ride.” In an interview, she revealed that she has no regrets over the union as it gave her Lindsie and Kyle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-08-21_05-12-40-fotor-2023082151656-692x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Do_Teresa_Terrys_Children_Have_a_Good_Relationship_With_Their_Father></span>Do Teresa Terry’s Children Have a Good Relationship With Their Father?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Although their relationship with their father has been rocky, they do. Lindsie appeared in the first five seasons of “Chrisley Knows Best.” However, her relationship with her father became stormy when she eloped with Will Campbell in 2012.</p><p>In an interview, Lindsie revealed she never wanted to be on her father’s reality show. She also disclosed in a podcast that she always felt like an outsider in the family. Hence, <a href=#>Lindsie said goodbye </a>to “Chrisley Knows Best.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-08-21_05-12-51-fotor-2023082151610-683x1024.jpg><p>However, Kyle, on the other hand, was only on the first season of the family reality show. According to reports, he got fired from the show after threatening to kill his dad while under the influence of drugs. Hence, Kyle cut ties with the family but overcame his drug addiction in 2019 and reconciled with his dad.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_Is_Teresa_Terry_Now></span>Where Is Teresa Terry Now?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Following the messy divorce and custody battle, Teresa Terry met a new partner, and they have two more children. Todd Chrisley’s ex-wife and her new partner live in Oklahoma with their children. She avoids the limelight surrounding her ex-husband and lives away from the media’s prying eyes.</p><p>Similarly, Todd Chrisley found love in his second wife and reality co-star, Julie Chrisley. The duo tied the knot a few months after Todd finalized his divorce from Teresa Terry in 1996. In addition, they have three children, Chase, Savannah, and Grayson Chrisley. However, things turned sour for the Chrisleys after Todd Chrisley’s alleged gay partner, <a href=#>Mark Braddock</a>, turned them in for a multimillion-dollar tax fraud.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kwaa%2BxKyYZqyVp7%2B6edOhnGatnqm8rbCMrKuoqqlivKd506ibnWWTnb%2Bqv8uesKxllp6%2FtMCMsKCfnV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./steve-stricker-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Steve Stricker Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
