"I think it's going to be one of the most challenging seasons," she continued. "We find that when a lot of people have been watching the show for many many seasons, they think they know the race really well and the cast comes on thinking, 'I have seen this a million times, I know exactly what to expect.' So we are definitely throwing in some twists and some curve balls into this season coming up. Get ready for season 24!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7prvNpaCnnV6YvK57zZ6urGdkbYV0gZVoq6GdXZa6osbIp55mqpGYsm6%2FxJqqqKZdZ4BussinmKWdXZa7pXnToZxmr5mju6a%2BjKKq</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./norb-guetle-obituary-news.html><span>←</span><span>Shocking!
