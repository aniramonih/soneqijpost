Many of the players had day jobs in the neighborhood, and many of them lived in boarding houses near the stadium, per <a href=#>Billy Penn</a>. They hung out at the YMCA and played football with neighborhood kids. The team had a band and a fight song, as well as cheerleaders and a mascot. And after covering expenses, the organization donated any further profits to local charities.</p><p dir=ltr>For all the strong organizational infrastructure and local support in the community, the Frankford Yellow Jackets were struggling by the early 1930s. <a href=#>The Great Depression</a> hit the Yellow Jackets from just about every angle imaginable, per <a href=#>The Washington Post</a>. The nearby textile mills shut down, which meant fans — and some players — lost their day jobs. As a result, ticket and concession sales were down. The team couldn't attract veteran players without a significant salary offering. Frankford Stadium, which was damaged in a fire in 1929, was finished off in a larger fire in 1931.</p><p dir=ltr>Soon, the Frankford Yellow Jackets were forced to become a traveling team in 1931 with no home field. After racking up a 1-6-1 record to start the season, the morale of the Yellow Jackets was decidedly low. One final blow — a 13 to 0 loss to the New York Giants on November 8, 1931 — led the Yellow Jackets to suspend operations, per the <a href=#>Free Library of Philadelphia</a>. They never recovered and declared bankruptcy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kHJrbG1pZMGpsYybmKejoqq9tXnNn6NmrJWWum7Ax5qrZqSVmXq1u4ytn55lk6eyosDIqKVmp5ZiwamxjKmfoqSRmbKtvMeimGadkZy5pr%2BO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taylor-nolan-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Taylor Nolan Bio (Wiki)</span></a>
