The conspiracy theory was that the Beatles musician was killed in a <a href=#>car crash</a> in 1966 and was replaced by a lookalike. This rumor gained so much steam that major news outlets covered it in hopes that it could be debunked (per <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a>). Not that it did any good. Believers doubled down on the idea, claiming that if certain Beatles tracks were played backward that proof could be heard. They also purport that the band themselves offered clues to his death, hidden on the cover of the "Abbey Road" album.</p><p>Of course, modern celebrities have been fodder for these same types of conspiracy theories. One of the most prevalent ones today centers around Beyonce, who according to the <a href=#>BBC</a>, is thought by some folks to have died years ago. One twist to this theory is that her forward-thinking producers knew that they had a goldmine with the former member of Destiny's Child. But they also knew that if something ever happened to her, they would lose a lot of money. So they did what any reasonable people would and commissioned a clone to be made of the pop star using her stem cells (via <a href=#>Life and Style Magazine</a>). And when she "died" more than a decade ago, one of the clones that they had produced took her place. And not one person noticed, except for some really savvy and hyper-observant fans on the internet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kHJucm5gZMGpsYyboLOZoqeybq%2FOp6qpoaKWsLp50q6eoJ2jqbavs4yypq6qXZuut7vRoqueZZOauaau0aKrop2jYq6zsYyio6WtnZ67osDIZpqlp56awHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-beauty-deals-amazon-october-prime-day-2023-7972791.html><span>←</span><span>The Best Beauty Deals in Prime Day Include K-Beauty, Sunday Riley, and More</span></a>
