The lyrics delve into the challenges he faces as he attempts to navigate his way through life and provide for his family, all while trying to break free from the confines of his circumstances.</p><p>The song’s hook encompasses the essence of the track, with lines like “Prolific, no gimmicks, trap like my soul’s missing, no living.” This line represents Green’s commitment to his hustle, resolute in his pursuit of success despite the obstacles stacked against him. He feels as though he is trapped, searching for a way out, and his determination to rise above his circumstances shines through.</p><p>Deep Green expresses his longing for a different life, where he can provide for his children and be a positive influence on their futures. He mentions “Two sons plus a girl on the way, I’m just tryna put this world on their plate.” This speaks to his desire for a better existence, where he can break the cycle of adversity and provide a better life for his family.</p><p>The artist uses vivid imagery to depict his experiences, comparing them to a maze that he must navigate and a cage from which he longs to escape. These metaphors add depth to the song, illustrating his feelings of entrapment and the challenges he faces in his daily life.</p><p>Deep Green’s lyrics also touch on the theme of drugs and crime, as he mentions being in the trap and breaking down Z’s (slang for ounces of drugs). However, he also emphasizes that he is hustling out of necessity, stating, “By any means necessary just like Malcolm X.” This reveals his awareness of the risks involved in his chosen path, but also his determination to provide for himself and his family, regardless of the consequences.</p><p>The second verse of “Prolific” further explores his aspirations and challenges. He references the late rapper Nipsey Hussle, known for his inspirational lyrics, citing “God will rise” as a way to find freedom from the truth. Deep Green emphasizes the importance of staying focused, grinding, and not allowing oneself to be sucked into the negative influences that surround him. He aspires to turn his life around, envisioning turning a Corsa (a small car) into a Rolls Royce as a metaphor for his transformation.</p><p>The song concludes with Deep Green sending a message of support to his friends who are also caught up in similar situations, expressing solidarity and unity among their struggles. He mentions the desire for their release and freedom, calling for the freedom of Tony, Bow, Blockz, and MB.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=My_Personal_Connection_to_%E2%80%9CProlific%E2%80%9D></span>My Personal Connection to “Prolific”<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>As I listen to “Prolific,” I can’t help but feel a mixture of admiration and empathy for Deep Green.
