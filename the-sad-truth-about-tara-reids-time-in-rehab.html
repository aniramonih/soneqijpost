"Tara Reid has checked herself into Promises Treatment Center. We appreciate your respect to her and her family's privacy at this time," a rep for the actor told People at the time. And while the rep did not disclose the cause for Reid's admittance into the treatment center, sources close to the actor confirmed that the move was Reid's decision.</p><p dir=ltr>However, another insider told the publication that the actor had developed a substance abuse issue. "Tara has a problem with alcohol," the source claimed to <a href=#>People</a>. "It's been at the root of much discomfort between herself and her family and friends." According to the publication, Reid had previously admitted to being a "social drinker." It didn't help that outlets like <a href=#>TMZ</a> posted videos of the actor out and about, apparently inebriated.&nbsp;And while initial reports suggested that Reid checked herself out of the rehab facility after three weeks, her reps confirmed to <a href=#>Access Hollywood</a> in January 2009 that she was still undergoing treatment (via <a href=#>TV Guide</a>).</p><p>If you or anyone you know needs help with addiction issues, help is available. Visit the <a href=#>Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration website</a> or contact SAMHSA's National Helpline at 1-800-662-HELP (4357).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhhaoR0hI6tn55lo5axbsDRrquhZZGXvLbAjK2Yq5ldp7KqsNJmq6KllWK2r3nRnp%2Baml8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-london-beckoned-songs-about-money-written-by-machines-by-panic-at-the-disco.html><span>←</span><span>The Meaning Behind The Song: London Beckoned Songs About Money Written by Machines by Panic at the D</span></a>
