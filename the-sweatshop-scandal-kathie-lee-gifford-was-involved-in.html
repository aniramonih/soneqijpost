"My first reaction was I don't need this," she confessed. "But they told me that I had a unique opportunity to make a difference by using what happened to me to stop the horrible practices of some of these manufacturers." After some prodding by New York Governor George Pataki and the U.S. Labor Secretary&nbsp;Robert B. Reich, Gifford opted to change course and, instead, waged a war against sweatshops.&nbsp;</p><p>As luck would have it, however, Gifford found herself smack dab in the middle of yet another controversy regarding poor working conditions in 1999. This time, it was purported that Gifford had hired thousands of Salvadoran women to work under unsafe and extreme conditions, which included 11-hour shifts, six days a week in sweltering conditions for a meager wage of 60 cents an hour, according to&nbsp;<a href=#>E! News</a>.</p><p>Once again, Gifford released a statement regarding the accusations and vowed to halt all manufacturing at the facility in question. But Gifford's move was not enough for whistleblower and head of the National Labor Committee, Charles Kernaghan. "Kathie Lee Gifford is a celebrity, a very influential and powerful person," he said, before taking her to task for not living up to her previous promises of putting an end to the sweatshops that manufacture her clothing.</p><p>We are going to go out on a limb here and guess that Gifford probably wishes she had never delved into the fashion world at all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma3Fibn5ze9OhnGarp5qutb%2FHqKdmq5OWu6Wty2aimqyYnrJuuMSeZKChlpu8s7CMsJisZZmjw7C41Z6bZqGeZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./justin-reyes-fatal-accident.html><span>←</span><span>The PaintBall Player Justin Reyes Fatal Accident: Know Everything About His Life, Cause Of Death, Ob</span></a>
