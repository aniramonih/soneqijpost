The cult was led by a preacher named David Berg –- but who, as <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a> reports, would call himself "Moses," perhaps indicating his character. Cults rarely admit they're cults, but there was a much deeper, much darker hidden reality to the Children of God. According to Gavin Edwards' biography "<a href=#>Last Night at the Viper Room: River Phoenix and the Hollywood He Left Behind</a>," they encouraged incest, adultery, and very early sexual experiences in children, inviting them to "play" with each other after their bedtime prayers.</p><p dir=ltr>Phoenix never commented on exactly what he experienced as a very young child during his time, but his older brother <a href=#>River did</a>. Apparently, River had his first sexual experience when he was only 4 years old: "But I've blocked it out. I was completely celibate from ten to fourteen." <a href=#>Joaquin Phoenix was only 3</a> when the family decided to leave the cult and head for the States once more (on a cargo ship going from Venezuela to Miami), but this doesn't mean that he wasn't subjected to trauma beforehand.</p><p dir=ltr>If you or anyone you know has been a victim of sexual assault, help is available. Visit the <a href=#>Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network website</a> or contact RAINN's National Helpline at 1-800-656-HOPE (4673).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCFlGppaXBfqbWmedOrmKChk2K%2Fpq3LZqOinpViwLW70bJkqJ5dn7yivdSipWaomKSyr7XXaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-net-worth-of-alex-mccord.html><span>←</span><span>The Net Worth of Alex McCord</span></a>
