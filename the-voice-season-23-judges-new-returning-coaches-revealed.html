<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>The Voice Season 23 Judges: Which Coaches Are Returning For The New Season?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>There will be an unexpected change among the judges for The Voice’s upcoming season. New contenders compete for the crown each year on the show. While some of the judges stayed the same and gave the program some comfort, everything is going to change.</p><p>The competitive series will debut on March 6, 2023, according to NBC. The panel of coaches will have two new faces, three departing coaches, and two returning coaches.</p><h3>The Voice Season 23 New Judges</h3><p>Here is a list of the brand-new judges who will be appearing on the program in the upcoming season.</p><h3>Niall Horan</h3><p>One of the two new judges for The Voice’s 23rd season is Niall Horan. The vocalist formerly belonged to One Direction, one of the largest boy bands in the world. Horan was one among the boys who split up and pursued individual music careers. His music tends toward pop, country, and soft rock.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/maxresdefault-10-1.jpg alt width=640 height=360 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3>Chance The Rapper</h3><p>Another brand-new judge for this year’s competition is rapper Chance. He is a well-known artist who rose to stardom after his second mixtape, Acid Rap, became an internet sensation. He has so far received three Grammy awards and is very active in community service. He is a self-made artist who has overcome all obstacles.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/bf5051ce1855ac3b2da65dad7c1d59d2.jpg alt width=400 height=279 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Returning JudgesExcept for Blake Shelton, these judges had previously appeared on the program but had to leave due to other obligations.</p><h3>Kelly Clarkson</h3><p>As one of the judges in the competition, Kelly Clarkson will make a comeback. From season 14 to season 21, the Stronger singer served as a coach. She left the program last season. Clarkson was replaced for season 22 by Camilla Cabello, much to the pleasure of fans, but she will be making a return. More than any other genre, pop music is where she leans.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/mgid_arc_imageassetref_cmt-1536x1024-1.jpg alt width=768 height=512 sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3>Blake Shelton</h3><p>The well-known country musician Blake Shelton will also make one final appearance on the program. Since he has been a part of the show from the start, he has been continuous throughout all 22 seasons.</p><p>However, the network revealed that he will leave the program after its 23rd season. So far, eight of the participants he has mentored have won the competition, while fifteen more have achieved iTunes No. 1 songs.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blake-shelton-announces-departure-from-the-voice-1536x1024-1.jpg alt width=768 height=512 sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>“I’ve been grappling with this for a while and I’ve decided that it’s time for me to move away from The Voice after season 23,” he remarked in reference to leaving the program. He stated that “it takes a lot of labor, enthusiasm, and alcoholic beverages (Ha!) to pull off a live show twice a week” in addition to thanking everyone who helped with the production.</p><h3>Judges That Left The show</h3><p>John Legend will be taking a break and stepping down as a judge after appearing on the program for six straight seasons. After serving as a judge for only one season, Camilla Cabello will not be coming back to the program. Gwen Stefani has now appeared and disappeared from the stage a few times.</p><p>With a diversity of judges this year, the season is sure to be a thriller. It will be pretty entertaining, featuring everyone from independent producer and rapper Chance the Rapper to the renowned Blake Shelton, Niall Horan, and Kelly Clarkson.</p><p>Fans of the show and Blake Shelton will both be anxiously awaiting what will be his final season on the program.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/logo-Finale.png alt itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>DCS</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Our Team DCS includes 5 different writers proficient in English and research based Content Writing.
