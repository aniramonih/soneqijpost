Listen Hollywood Life</h1></header><section class=post-content><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-weekend-future-new-song-shading-ciara-bella-hadid-ftr.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-2>It’s only been a couple of weeks since<strong> The Weeknd</strong>, 26, and <strong>Bella Hadid</strong>, 20, called it quits, but the “Starboy” singer might have already released a nasty breakup song. An official music video hasn’t been released for “Six Feet Under” yet, so we’re relying on the scathing lyrics to tell the story. The Weeknd starts by <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>describing a woman who’s as cold as ice</a>. “She don’t get emotional, kill off all her feelings, that’s why she ain’t approachable.” Reports claimed the model and the musician broke up due to conflicting schedules, but this song suggest there were deeper issues.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“Six Feet Under” also features rapper <strong>Future</strong>, who may be jumping on the vengeful train&nbsp;to&nbsp;diss his ex-girlfriend as well, <strong>Ciara</strong>. The hip-hop couple didn’t&nbsp;have the friendliest breakup either, considering Future allegedly cheated on his fiancée, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>forcing her to call off the engagement</a>&nbsp;in 2014. Future and Ciara share one child together, a son named&nbsp;<strong>Future Zahir Wilburn</strong>,&nbsp;so let’s hope he doesn’t hear “Six Feet Under” any time soon.</p><h3>Bella Hadid Vs. Kylie Jenner — See Their Hottest Pics</h3><p id=content-paragraph-6>The Weeknd’s track progressively gets worse, though. “She don’t give a f-ck about anybody, and she got her whole crew poppin’, and she bend it over like she ain’t got no back bone.” This might be a stretch, but it sounds like The Weeknd is insinuating that Bella cheated on him over the course of their year and a half romance. As for Bella’s rebuttal, maybe she’ll make her singing debut with the helps of BFF <strong>Taylor Swift</strong>! At this point, anything could happen!</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, do you think “Six Feet Under” is about Bella and Ciara?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlmZH5ye5FuZq2glWLEprHKp5tmnJmowKa%2FjJucpaSRYrWisMidZKedp2LAsLrGZqqisF2bsqbAjK6lnZ2iYrmqv9OepWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-sun-2-speed-crossword-answers-for-january-25-2024.html><span>←</span><span>The Sun 2-Speed Crossword Answers for January 25 2024</span></a>
