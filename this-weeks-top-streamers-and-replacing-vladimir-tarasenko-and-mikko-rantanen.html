While it’s possible Rantanen may return in a couple weeks, the news isn’t as good for Tarasenko as the Blues announced he’ll require surgery on his left shoulder and he’ll be re-evaluated in five months."><meta name=author content="Kelle Repass"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

With only two teams scheduled to play four games for the week, this is more of a buy-low, sell-high themed piece with a few deep league adds sprinkled in. The goal here is to try and help owners replace <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Vladimir Tarasenko</a> and <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Mikko Rantanen</a>. Both right wingers and both extremely difficult to replace.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>While it’s possible Rantanen may return in a couple weeks, the news isn’t as good for Tarasenko as the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Blues</a> announced he’ll require surgery on his left shoulder and he’ll be re-evaluated in five months.&nbsp; Certainly replacing him is easier said than done, unless you play in a shallow league. Even still, the loss of Tarasenko has likely created a huge hole on the right side of your fantasy hockey team.</p><p>The requests to get this waiver wire article up Sunday morning to help better set your week have been heard. With 12 teams scheduled to pay four games in Week 5 (Nov. 4 – Nov. 11), you can bet on several four-game streams to consider.</p><p>In the meantime, make sure to check out the <a href=#>Four Stacked Lines</a> podcast with <a href=#>Eric Young</a> and myself on Friday’s. We try and help you finish your week strong with weekend streams, and we set you up for the following week with four-game streams. On Tuesday’s we are joined by some of your favorite hockey writers here at The Athletic. <a href=#>Most recently</a>, we were fortunate enough to have <a href=#>Alison Lukan</a> join us as she shared insight on her <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Columbus Blue Jackets</a> as well as some advice for those in need of production in net.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>It’s easy enough to say pick up this guy and pick up that guy, but who you dropping? <a href=#>@TheEricYoung</a> and I are here to try and help. <a href=#>https://t.co/qeVMqyuNPa</a></p><p>— Chris Meaney (@chrismeaney) <a href=#>October 26, 2019</a></p><p>Honestly, the best way to replace super star forwards, is by streaming or buying low on struggling players, so let’s get into it.</p><h3><strong>Four-game streams</strong></h3><p><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Calgary Flames</a></strong> (Tue @ CAR, Thu @ NAS, Sat @ CBJ, Sun @ WAS)</p><ul><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Mikael Backlund</a>, C — </strong>He only has two goals and four points, but 24 FOW in his past three games. He’s also put at least two pucks on goal in six straight games.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Noah Hanifin</a>, D — </strong>60-plus hits, blocks and shots.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Cam Talbot</a>, G&nbsp;— </strong>Decent weekend stream vs CBJ or WAS.</li></ul><p><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Vancouver Canucks</a></strong> (Mon vs. FLA, Wed @ LA, Fri @ ANA, Sat @ SJ)</p><ul><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Tanner Pearson</a>, LW — </strong>Pearson’s 29 shots rank second on the Canucks, behind <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Bo Horvat</a>.</li><li><strong>Micheal Ferland, LW/RW — </strong>Ferland’s 27 hits are nine more than the next closest (<a class=ath_autolink href=#>Alexander Edler</a>).</li><li><strong>Brandon Sutter, C — </strong>Logs a ton of time on ice, but a face-off stream only.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Thatcher Demko</a>, G — </strong>Demko has won two of his three starts and makes for a good stream against either the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Ducks</a> or <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Sharks</a>.</li></ul><h3><strong>Two games&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>You could drop these guys if you have a streamers mentality or play in shallow leagues.</p><h3><strong>Make sure they’re owned</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Bo Horvat, C</strong> <strong>(VAN)</strong> — Horvat was high in the rankings and with six points in his past three games, his ownership should finally creep into the 60 percent mark.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Brock Nelson</a>, C (NYI)&nbsp;— </strong>10 points in 10 games. Career high 25 goals and 53 points last season.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Paul Stastny</a>, C</strong> <strong>(VGK)</strong> — Still producing and still available.</li><li><strong>Ryan Getzlaf, C (ANH) — </strong>Has lost a step but still a very solid fantasy player: 5 goals, 2 PPG, 27 hits, 31 shots and 97 face-off wins. He had 48 points in 67 games last season and 61 in 56 the year before — 50 points are within reach.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Nick Schmaltz</a>, C/LW/RW (ARI)&nbsp;— </strong>11 points in 10 games and 25 in 27 with <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Arizona</a> dating back to last season. Multiple eligibility is nice.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jonathan Drouin</a>, C/LW (MON) — </strong>Five goals and 10 points in 11 games. Back to playing with <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Max Domi</a>. Looks motivated.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>James van Riemsdyk</a> LW (PHI)&nbsp;— </strong>EY and I said it was only a matter of time before JVR found the back of the net. Three goals in his last three games and ranks inside the Top 10 LW in shots on goal (39). Top 20 overall in 5v5 shots (27). Also, while we’re at it… JVR has scored at least 27 goals in five of his past six seasons and at least 30 twice.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Travis Konecny</a>, RW (PHI) — </strong>Back-to-back seasons with 24 goals and six already this season, yet nobody wants to own him.</li><li><strong>Andreas Johnsson, LW/RW (TOR)&nbsp;— </strong>You take the bad with the good and the upside is there playing with <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Auston Matthews</a>.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Tyler Bertuzzi</a>, LW/RW (DET)&nbsp;— </strong>The <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Red Wings</a> have been juggling lines, but I don’t think it matters to Bertuzzi.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Kevin Hayes</a>, C (PHI</strong>) — Another Flyer. I treat the entire Top 6 in Philly the same as I treat the Top 6 in Dallas. There are plenty of players on these two teams who are either available via the trade or waiver wire. Hayes has three goals and six points over a four-game point streak.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Kevin Labanc</a>, LW/RW (SJ)&nbsp;— </strong>Goals in three straight, and five on the season. Playing a career high 16:49 minutes per game.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Neal Pionk</a>, D (WPG)&nbsp;— </strong>Piling up statistics, including 23 minutes per game.</li></ul><h3><strong>Let’s dig deeper</strong></h3><ul><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Lars Eller</a>, C (WAS) — </strong>10 points while playing a career-high 16:48 per game. Ranks eighth in face-off wins.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jordan Staal</a>, C (CAR) — </strong>Staal logs a bit more ice than Eller and he’ll throw his body around more.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Joel Armia</a>, RW&nbsp;— </strong>Armia has six goals with three coming on the power play. He’s skating with Domi and Drouin, which has resulted in a career high 17:03 of ice time. He has a combined 50 shots and hits: 2.7 SPG&nbsp; and 2.9 HPG. Armia is the first person I’d go searching for if I were a Tarasenko owner.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Ryan Strome</a>, C/RW&nbsp;— </strong>Strome has five points over a four-game point steak. His 21:49 minutes on ice in his latest contest was the most he’s played this season, and he’s logged at least 17:47 in four straight games. He won’t put up zeros in the FOW or HIT categories either. He’s also been skating alongside <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Artemi Panarin</a>, plus, the injury to <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Mika Zibanejad</a> could mean even more ice time.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Brandon Tanev</a>, LW/RW (PIT)&nbsp;— </strong>He won’t score often, but it’s an added bonus to the 49 hits you just acquired.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Calle Jarnkrok</a>, LW/RW (NAS)&nbsp;— </strong>Jarnkork is getting a chance to play on the top line with some injuries in Nashville. He has goals in back-to-back games and nine points this season. He played a season-high 19:09 minutes in his latest game.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>J.T. Compher</a>, C/RW (COL)&nbsp;— </strong>Logged 20:38 minutes in Colorado’s latest game as he filled in on the top line for Rantanen. He may not stick, but he has five points in his past five games.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Tony DeAngelo</a>, D (NYR)&nbsp;— </strong>There’s no question the Rangers are going to allow plenty of goals this season, but they are also going to score a few too. DeAngelo has three goals and six points in his past three games, with two of them coming on the power play.</li></ul><h3>Buy-low</h3><ul><li><strong>Artemi Panarin, LW</strong></li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Taylor Hall</a>, LW</strong></li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Blake Wheeler</a>, RW</strong></li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Sebastian Aho</a>, C</strong></li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Alex DeBrincat</a>, LW/RW</strong></li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Joe Pavelski</a>, C/RW</strong></li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Tyler Seguin</a>, C</strong></li><li><strong>Alexander Radulov, RW</strong></li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Timo Meier</a>, LW/RW</strong></li><li><strong>P.K.

Elliott should be added if you need help in goal.</li><li><strong>Henrik Lundqvist</strong> — who I’d have a hard time owning — is dealing with an upper-body injury. <strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Alexandar Georgiev</a></strong> may blow up those ratios, but Ottawa and Detroit coming up this week.</li><li><strong>MacKenzie Blackwood</strong> was lit up in his latest game, so we could see the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Devils</a> go back to <strong>Cory Schneider</strong> who has the higher ceiling of the two.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jake Allen</a></strong> is not even good enough to get the second of a back-to-back. Good news for <strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jordan Binnington</a></strong> owners.</li><li>The Coyotes are going back to <strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Darcy Kuemper</a></strong> despite <strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Antti Raanta</a></strong> winning Arizona’s last game. It’s a duo I’d rock, though.</li></ul><p>(Top photo: Scott Rovak/NHLI via Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57kGxpbW1kZXxzfJByZmpoX2eFcMDHoqpmr5WauLR506inZqukp7KiucSrqmaZnpl6s7HPpZicoZ6cere4wJ2gpqGiYsGivsCsnKejn2Kur7CMpqCko59iv6K605qlnqZf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sam-edelman-boots-nordstrom.html><span>←</span><span>These Sam Edelman Boots Are on Sale &amp;amp; We Need Them in Every Color</span></a>
