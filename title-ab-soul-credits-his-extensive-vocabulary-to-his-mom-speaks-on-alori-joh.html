Charlie Brown, Dr. Seuss books. And from there I developed a very – I learned how to read very well very young. Since then I’ve just been a sponge. I just listen very well. I mean I don’t really read a lot of books like that. I’ve read a few great books, but I’m really just a listener you know what I mean? A thinker, I think for myself. Observant more so than just reading literature.”</p><p>During his interview with Fader, Ab-Soul also spoke on the recent death of his friend and singer <a href=#>Alori Joh</a>. Alori Joh appeared on numerous songs with both Kendrick Lamar and Ab-Soul and is also featured on Ab-Soul’s Control System.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“I was actually pretty much done with the project before that happened. Luckily for me and all of us cause I definitely don’t think I would have been able to put it out in the time that I did,” Ab-Soul explained. “It was difficult. It’s still very difficult. She helps me out with all of my projects. It’s a very difficult thing to get over but at the same time this is what we’ve been – we, me and her, were working on for the majority of the time I’ve known her. She was one of my biggest supporters so I feel like I owe her and I owe everybody else that’s taken a liking to what we’re doing.”</p><p>Ab-Soul’s most recent project <a href=#>Control System</a> was released on May 11th.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.youtube.com/vi/qWVrD2mLz7A/0.jpg border=0 width=640 height=430 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=question><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=#>Ab-Soul Speaks On How He Inspired “HiiiPoWeR,” Explains Black Lip Bastard Nickname</a></p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mignWZiZX5xfY6toK2klWOuo3nSqKylZZOnsqW106xkoaGjYrK5wMSnqqKulWLDsK%2FAm6ylmaKuerW7jKGgrGWdpLpuv8%2BemKSrXaS7bq3LqKmiZZqktQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1115456-nigeria-outfits-latest-tendencies-trends-photos-html.html><span>←</span><span>50+ Nigerian outfits 2022: latest fashion and style trends (photos)</span></a>
