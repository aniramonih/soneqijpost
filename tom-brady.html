But if you don’t know all that much about the superstar, then fear not because we’re on hand to help.</p><p>In this blog, we’re going to run through the key details that’ll give you the cheat-sheet outline of just who the Californian is — and why he’s so respected.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tom-brady-img-1-560x400.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>His Power</h2><p>The first thing to know about Tom Brady is: he’s a very good football player. There aren’t too many 43-year-olds who can play in the NFL, let alone win the Super Bowl. But that’s just what Brady did in 2020. And he’s still going strong, too.</p><p>Despite being 44, the quality of Brady’s performances means that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are among the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">favorites to win the Super Bowl</a> for the second year in a row. How many more years he has in the NFL is anyone’s guess.</p><p>In truth, he shouldn’t be playing now, yet he’s still there. And not just playing, but playing exceptionally well.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>His Background</h2><p>That’s where Tom Brady is now. But it wasn’t always that way, of course. Indeed, in another life, he might have been a professional baseball player. He passed up the chance to be a pro slugger in 1995, opting instead to study at the University of Michigan.</p><p>Though he played for the Wolverine’s <a href=#>college football</a> team, he spent next to no time on the field in his first two seasons. In his final two years, however, he rose to prominence and eventually led Michigan to Orange Bowl success.</p><p>After leaving college, he signed for the New England Patriots, quickly becoming the best quarterback in the NFL. He took them to nine Super Bowl finals in his twenty years with the team, winning four.</p><p>At the close of the 2019 season, Brady left the Patriots and signed for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, where he made history by lifting the Vince Lombardi Trophy.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Controversy</h2><p>Though he has a reputation as being a model, All-American professional football player, Brady has also been involved in some controversies, the most famous of which became known as ‘deflategate.’</p><p>This is the allegation that Brady asked that the footballs used in the AFC Championship Game against the Indianapolis Colts be deflated, thus giving him an advantage.</p><p>After a back and forth in court, the US Court of Appeals found Brady guilty and upheld the decision to suspend him for four regular-season games.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tom-brady-img-2-560x400.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Personal Life</h2><p>Tom Brady is married to Gisele Bündchen, a Brazilian model. He and his wife met in 2006 and were married in Santa Monica, California, on February 26, 2009. Together, they have two children.</p><p>Brady also has another child from a previous marriage. He lives with his family in Brookline, Massachusetts, and New York City, and also owns many other properties around the United States, including in Florida and Montana.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Lifestyle</h2><p>To the outside world, Brady’s football achievements are a mystery, especially given his age. To the people that know him, it’s anything but mysterious.</p><p>The football star follows a very healthy lifestyle; he practices meditation and yoga follows an 80/20 diet, and goes to bed at 8:30 pm during the NFL season. In addition, he has a plant-based diet and says he drinks around 200 ounces of water each day.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Conclusion</h2><p>Will there be a better football player than Tom Brady?</p><p>Yes. But whether there’s ever another 43-year-old who wins the Super Bowl in his season with a new team is far from likely. His post-football career will be worth following, too.</p><p>This, after all, is a man who continually defies the odds to achieve success. Brady says that his craziest dream is to become a US senator, but given everything that’s done already, you’d have to say that it doesn’t sound that crazy.</p><h1 class="mvp-post-title left">All You Need to Know About Jevon Holland: The Highest-Profile Canadian in the NFL Right Now</h1><img width=1200 height=720 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/nfl.jpg alt="All You Need to Know About Jevon Holland: The Highest-Profile Canadian in the NFL Right Now" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>There are 18 Canadian players on the active rosters of NFL teams in the 2023-24 season. None are catching the eye more than Jevon Holland. The 23-year-old Coquitlam-born safety was drafted by the Miami Dolphins in 2021 after impressing in two seasons of college football with the Oregon Ducks.</p><p>Holland has not looked back ever since, establishing himself as a regular in the Dolphins team, posting some serious tackle and interception figures.</p><p>In fact, Holland is now the starting free safety position for Miami. So far in 2023, Holland has registered 44 solo tackles, just four shy of the 48 he amassed in his entire debut season in 2021.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Holland and the Dolphins are in great shape for a 2024 Super Bowl bid</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/nfl.jpg><p>Holland could be celebrating winning his first Lombardi Trophy next year too if the bookmakers’ odds are to be believed. The Dolphins are currently rated as +800 fifth favorites to land the 2024 Super Bowl with the <a href=# rel=noopener>Ontario-licensed sports betting online operator Betano</a>, which has served the Canadian province since receiving its license in October 2022.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Holland’s first ever NFL touchdown was a big one – in more ways than one!</h2><p>Holland played a key role in the Dolphins’ recent victory over the New York Jets. Holland completed a stunning interception of a hail Mary pass, before returning it with interest for a stunning 99-yard touchdown. It was the first touchdown of Holland’s NFL career and it steered Miami to a comfortable 34-13 victory.</p><p>It’s a win which keeps Miami firmly top of the AFC East. In fact, only the Baltimore Ravens have made a better start to the 2023-24 NFL season in the AFC.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The British Columbian safety did more than assist the Dolphins in their quest for victory over the Jets that day. His full-field return triggered an eagerly anticipated giveaway worth over $1 million. During the NFL preseason, electronics firm TCL launched its “Ultimate Gameday Upgrade” committing to give away $1 million worth of 98” televisions if a player managed to score a touchdown from a minimum of 98 yards in.</p><p>Holland beat the minimum by a single yard. TCL also made sure Holland received a 98” TV too, as reward for his feat.</p><p>Holland has missed the last few games for the Dolphins after sustaining a sprain to his medial ligaments in both knees. This disappointing injury was suffered in the same game as his majestic touchdown against the Jets.</p><p>The team continues to use kid gloves with Holland, pushing him only sparingly into team practice. Holland himself admits <a href=# rel=noopener>he’s “taking his time” with his rehab</a> to ensure he returns at the peak of his powers.</p><p>The Dolphins realize just how important Holland has become to their defense, as he also serves as the quarterback of the secondary. Head coach Mike McDaniel described Holland as being “diligent” with his recovery, especially with the chance of a deep postseason run looming.</p><p><strong>Holland’s path to NFL stardom</strong></p><p>Miami is reaping the rewards of recognizing Holland’s undoubted potential in the NFL after making him their second-round pick of the 2021 NFL Draft. Holland had impressed during his scholarship with the Oregon Ducks in the <a href=#>same way as outside linebacker Kayvon Thibodeaux</a>, who was later recruited by the New York Giants.</p><p>Holland’s rookie season saw him display his physical prowess from day one. He exhibited a rare combination of athleticism, football intelligence, and a knack for disrupting opposing offenses. His ability to cover ground in the secondary, make crucial tackles, and create turnovers has earned him rave reviews from Dolphins fans and respect from his peers across the league.</p><p>Beyond his on-field contributions, Holland’s leadership qualities and adaptability have also been noteworthy. Whether patrolling the backfield or contributing on special teams, Holland has quickly established himself as a versatile asset to the Dolphins.</p><h1 class="mvp-post-title left">Santi Aldama Is Getting Married to His Girlfriend Pilar Barquin</h1><span class="mvp-post-excerpt left"><p>Congrats to the couple!</p></span><img width=1200 height=720 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Santi-Aldama-Girlfriend.jpg alt="Santi Aldama Is Getting Married to His Girlfriend Pilar Barquin" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Santi Aldama is a Spanish professional basketball player for the National Basketball Association’s (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NBA</a>) Memphis Grizzlies.</p><p>Before being drafted into the NBA, he was a Loyola Greyhounds basketball player in college. Likewise, he was selected as the 2019 FIBA U18 European Championship’s most valuable player (MVP).</p><p>2023 was a very important year for Aldama —&nbsp; both professionally and personally. He scored his career high in February 2023 and got engaged to his girlfriend in September 2023.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Santi Aldama’s relationship with future wife and dating history</h2><p>Aldama has been dating his girlfriend, Pilar Barquin, for quite some time. He is very secretive about his personal life, so he has not revealed anything about his dating history or his past relationships.</p><p>As a result of his privacy, it’s unknown if he had dated anyone before he began dating his future wife. Similarly, the details of his relationship with his girlfriend-turned-fiancee are not known. It is unknown when the duo first met or how they started dating.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>However, it looks like they have been together before the summer of 2021. Barquin first posted her boyfriend on Instagram in July 2021.</p><p>She <a href=# data-type=link data-id="https://www.instagram.com/p/CR9rgfkr52b/?img_index=1" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted</a> a series of photos with his with the caption, “un día más admirándote y sintiéndome la persona más afortunada del mundo!! Enhorabuena,” which roughly translates to “One more day admiring you and feeling like the luckiest person in the world!! Congratulations.”</p><p>Since then, Barquin has been more comfortable sharing photos of her boyfriend on her social media. On the other hand, Aldama first posted about his girlfriend and revealed that he was dating Barquin in May 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>Since they have been dating, Aldama and his girlfriend have celebrated Christmas together with their family. After dating for at least two years, the duo got engaged in September 2023.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image.png><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Santi Aldama might get married to his girlfriend soon.

Aldama has not referred to Barquin as his wife, and neither has Barquin referred to the athlete as her husband.</p><p>So, it looks like the two are not married yet but might be planning for their dream wedding. For now, fans of the NBA star will have to wait patiently to see their favorite player share the wedding vows with his partner.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Santi Aldama’s family and career</h2><p>Aldama was raised in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Gran Canaria, Spain. He began playing basketball at the age of three because of his family.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>He was inspired by his own family, especially his father, Santiago, who played professional basketball in Spain and Portugal before joining the Spanish national team in the 1992 Summer Olympics. His uncle, Santi Toledo, also played professional basketball in Spain, Italy, and Portugal.</p><p>Aldama began his basketball career with Canterbury Basketball Academy in Las Palmas and subsequently elected to stay there despite having offers from major clubs such as FC Barcelona, Real Madrid, and Gran Canaria.</p><p>He <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">averaged</a> 18.9 points, 5.1 rebounds, and 3.6 assists per game while playing for Canterbury with Oumar Ballo in the 2017 Spanish Under-16 Championship.&nbsp;</p><p>He was instrumental in his side finishing third, behind FC Barcelona and Real Madrid.

He was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">lured</a> to the school because his father knew assistant coach Ivo Simovi and because Aldama hoped to one day work in business, and he felt at ease when he visited in June 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>Many analysts were surprised by Aldama’s decision to play for a mid-major program as he was considered a four-star recruit and a high-major player.&nbsp;</p><p>Aldama was out for the first three months of his rookie season due to a knee ailment that necessitated surgery. On February 1, 2020, he made his college debut for Loyola Maryland, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">scoring</a> 11 points in 17 minutes in a 79-73 win over Navy.</p><p>In four weeks, Aldama was voted Patriot League Rookie of the Week three times.

Aldama declared for the NBA draft on April 14, 2021, while still retaining his collegiate eligibility.&nbsp;</p><p>Later, he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">decided</a> to stay in the draft. The Utah Jazz selected Aldama with the 30th overall choice in the 2021 NBA Draft.
