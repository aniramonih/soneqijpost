If you want to learn that, <i>Dateline</i> Correspondent <a href=#><strong>Andrea Canning</strong></a> is the one to learn from. She perfectly balances her professional and personal life with six children.</p><p>The 46-year-old news correspondent tied the knot when she was 35. Despite the age, she is now the proud mother of six children together with her fighter pilot husband. Are you curious to know more about Andrea's married life? If yes, then read along.</p><h2>Tony Bancroft lifted the Losing Hope of Andrea</h2><p>Canning achieved all the success she could in her professional life. Despite all the success, Andrea felt void in her life, which can be filled by getting married. After some initial trial to find the special one, Andrea started to lose hope on the whole marriage thing.</p><p>Before joining <i>NBC</i>, Andrea served at <i>ABC News,</i> where White House Correspondent <strong>Martha Raddatz</strong> played the role of matchmaker to Canning. As per Raddatz, she found the perfect person for Andrea, and well, she was 100 percent correct in her judgment.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/10/18/Andrea-Canning-1571391859496.jpg><p>Martha got the fighter pilot Lt. Col. <strong>Tony Bancroft</strong> and Canning to met each other. During the matchmaking, Tony served in Iraq so, the couple only exchanged conversations via mail and phone call. After the deployment was over, the pair met each other and fell in love at first sight.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Wedding Proposal</h2><p>In 2007, Andrea's mother died of breast cancer, and during a hard time, Tony came down from his family holiday at Blue Mountain. Moments like these brought the couple even closer.</p><p>Finally, in September 2007, Bancroft took out the ring and asked the big question to Canning while they were strolling on the beach at Cuttyhunk Island. Tony wanted Andrea to feel the special connection with the island, just like him and his family. Even though Cuttyhunk Island holds a special place in the pair's heart, they tied the knot at Blue Mountain.</p><h2>The Wedding Details</h2><p>Nearly after a year, On June 7, 2008, Andrea walked down the aisle on<i> Blue Mountain Inn</i>. The ceremony saw the arrival of their loved ones, and in no time, 215 guests filled the venue.&nbsp;</p><p>Reverend <strong>Heather Stacey</strong> pronounced the couple man and woman after the pair exchanged each other wedding vows. For the weddings, Andrea arrived in a <a href=#><strong>satin-lined gown with a flower-embossed ivory tulle overlay.</strong></a> On the other hand, Tony looked absolute gentleman in his Blue Marine Corps dress.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/10/18/andrea-canning-wedding-1571391467917.jpg><p>After the nuptials, the duo walked out of the church, where they were given the guard of honor in a traditional military saber arch.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Newest Addition in a Family is a Boy!</h2><p>After raising five daughters, Canning is now ready to be a mom for the sixth time. On January 4, 2019, Canning and her hubby, along with her five children, attended a show on <i>Today,</i> where the <i>NBC</i> correspondent announced her pregnancy with her sixth child.</p><p>She gave birth to her first child <strong>Anna Bancroft</strong> after two years of her marriage. After that, in a decade long marital relationship, Canning became the mother to <strong>Charlie Bancroft, Kiki Bancroft, Georgia Bancroft</strong>, and <strong>Elle Bancroft</strong>. On June 2019, her sixth child, a boy <strong>George Anthony Bancroft II,</strong> became the newest addition to the family.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/10/18/Andrea%20children-1571391671748.JPG><p>With her elder daughter growing, <a href=#><strong>they are a big help for Andrea to balance her work-life.</strong></a><strong> </strong>Upon the announcement of the birth of her son, many fans congratulated her via social media, including her colleagues at <i>NBC</i> <a href=#><strong>Katy Blakey</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=#><strong>Laura Garcia</strong></a>, and <a href=#><strong>Kristen Welker</strong></a><strong>,</strong> to name a few.</p><p>For further updates, keep reading <a href=#>MarriedCeleb.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jq2mp7Fdl66vr9Gona1lkaOxbq3NnamemV2Yrq%2B6yKeeZqWRp7%2BqscNmo6KelQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nadir-khayat-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Nadir Khayat Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
