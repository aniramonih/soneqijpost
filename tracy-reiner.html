It grossed over $464 million, from which Tracy got her fair share. But she is not entirely dependent on her acting career only, you see.</p><p>At the moment, this successful actress is also CEO of ‘Manifesto Films Inc‘ that brings in a lot of cash, we suppose.</p><h2>How Old Is Tracy Reiner? – Age, Height, and Other Measurements</h2><p>Pretty Woman actress Tracy Reiner is 55 years as of now. Born in 1964, the American actress will soon turn 56 on the seventh of July this year. Also, her sun sign is Cancer, which is known to be emotional and sensitive compared to other signs.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bonnie Aarons Bio- Age, Height, Movies, The Nun, Married, Net Worth >></a></h4><p>Likewise, Tracy stands tall at 5 feet 6 inches(168 cm) while she weighs around 60 kgs(133 lbs). Not to mention, the actress has seen significant changes to her body throughout the years.</p><p>Other than that, the American actress has got striking dark brown eyes and long dark brown hair.</p><h4><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> 15 of Reiner’s relatives were employed at labs run by the United States Atomic Energy Commission.</h4><p>Also, the actress has not mentioned much when it comes to her siblings as well.</p><h2>Early Life and Education- Is Tracy Reiner Related to Rob Reiner?</h2><p>The beautiful brunette actress was born <strong>Tracy Henry</strong> in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in the United States of America. Tracy is the daughter of actress and director <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Penny Marshall</a> and <strong>Michael Henry.</strong></p><p>Reiner was just three years old when her parents divorced, and it led to live with her grandparents<strong>, Carl Reiner</strong> and <strong>Estelle Reiner,</strong> in New Mexico.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/tracy-001.jpg><p>Not to mention, Reiner is also a niece of filmmaker <strong>Garry Marshall</strong>. Many might not know this, but Tracy was raised by her mother and her adoptive father, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Rob Reiner</a>. To speak, Rob is also a well-respected filmmaker, actor, and director in Hollywood.</p><p>Similarly, Tracy grew up as an American while her ethnicity is mixed. Her mother, Penny, is of Italian, English, German, and Scottish descent.</p><h2>Personal Life and Marriage: Husband</h2><p>Talking about her personal life, Tracy is not so eager to the public yet. Despite the lack of information, we know that the ‘Pretty Woman’ actress is married to her husband,<strong> Matthew Theodore Conlan</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/tracy-003.jpg><p>It is mentioned when and how they met or even married. Hence, the information may come as something unfulfilling. Likewise, the happily married Reiner has two daughters with her husband, namely <strong>Bellan Conlan</strong> and <strong>Viva Conlan</strong>.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryan Eggold Bio, Height, The Blacklist, Girlfriend, Net Worth >></a></h4><p>Aside from her own, Tracy now mothers three children from Matthew’s previous marriage. So, in total, Tracy takes care of five children.</p><p>Nonetheless, Tracy is beyond happy and has lived a peaceful life with her husband and five children. As of now, the Conlan family resides in the city of Los Angeles, California, the United States of America.</p><h2>Professional Career: Pretty Woman</h2><p>Coming from a star-studded family, it came as no surprise when Tracy, too, pursued her career in the field of entertainment. As we have already mentioned, Reiner’s mother is an actress while her step-father is also a respected individual in the industry as a director and actor.</p><p>Even though we want to know, not much is recorded when it comes to her career and the struggle she faced along the way. Without a doubt, Tracy must have faced many criticisms and expectations as well from the people.</p><p>Always being compared to her mother must not have been easy for her to cope with. On the bright side, Reiner did manage to have a decent career in acting, as we all know.</p><p>Likewise, the American born made her debut performance from the small screen. In 1977 she starred in the TV show titled Laverne & Shirley, where Reiner portrayed the role of <strong>Helen</strong>. After that, the actress continued appearing in the show playing numerous characters.</p><p>Also, Tracy’s other television appearances include Partners in Life(1990) and A League of Their Own(1993).&nbsp;</p><p>However, it was not until 1984 that she made an appearance on the silver screen. Her debut on the big screen started with The Flamingo Kid, followed by The Sure Thing and Nothing in Common simultaneously.</p><p>Moreover, in her decade long career, the actress has appeared in dozens of movies alone. Some of her notable works include Big(1988), Die Hard(1988), When Harry Met Sally…(1989), Masque of the Red Death(1989), Pretty Woman(1990), A League of Their Own(1992), Apollo 13(1995), That Thing You Do! (1996)The Other Sister(1999), The Princess Diaries(2001), Raising Helen(2004), State’s Evidence(2006), Chloe and Theo(2015), and many others.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mike Judge Age, Height, Career, Wife, Net Worth >></a></h4><p>As time went on, Tracy ha indulged herself in other activities aside from acting. In fact, Reiner was an associate producer of the documentary titled Children of the Revolution Tune Back In(2005).&nbsp;</p><h2>Social Media Presence</h2><p>Also, it seems the actress is not much in touch with the public at all. She is not active on Instagram and can only be found on Twitter.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Twitter</a>–&nbsp; 248 Followers</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmispqi1sMPSrZirq16YvK5706uYnLFdp7KqusSrZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tim-armstrong-rancid.html><span>←</span><span>Tim Armstrong (Rancid) | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
