CEO of IncrEDIBLE Eats, Dinesh Tadepalli, had four sharks fighting for the chance to join the edible cutlery company including Kevin O'Leary, Mark Cuban, Lori Greiner, and guest judge, Daniel Lubetzky. Ultimately, Tadepalli decided to go with Greiner at $500,000 for a 15% stake in the company.</p><p>But, what was supposed to be an exciting time for Tadepalli quickly turned sour. Just months after striking <a href=#>a deal with Greiner</a>, the contract between the two fell through. Tadepalli gave vague details about the fallout <a href=#>with Joe Pardo</a> in December 2021. He shared, "One thing I can tell you, for undisclosed reasons, the deal didn't go through, unfortunately. But, I still value the fact that we were on air." Even as time went on, Tadepalli was still hush-hush about what went down with him and Greiner. However, he did disclose to <a href=#>WSOC-TV</a>, "They changed the deal terms." So, perhaps Greiner was hoping to invest less money than she initially wanted to into the company, or maybe she wanted a bigger stake. Whatever it was that unfolded between the two, it ultimately led to Tadepalli having to figure things out on his own once again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtkZ4Z6g46tqa6smGKuo7vUrWSippOnsqW1waWcZp2RqcBurcWtnKtlo52us7eMrZino18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-amazing-race-season-23-finale-and-the-winner-is.html><span>←</span><span>The Amazing Race Season 23 Finale: And the Winner Is...</span></a>
