On March 19, 2020, Gabbard dropped out of the 2020 race and endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden.</p><p>Gabbard was assigned as Bernie Sanders's running mate in California for any write-in votes for Sanders. Shortly after the election, she was mentioned as a possible presidential candidate for 2020.</p><p>Gabbard was the most frequently Googled candidate after the first, second, and fourth 2020 Democratic debates.</p><p>Gabbard's political positions are broadly similar to those of other 2020 Democratic primary contenders on healthcare, climate, education, infrastructure, and criminal justice reform. However, she has distinguishable positions on issues ranging from Democratic Party internal politics to foreign affairs.</p><p>Gabbard's domestic policy platform in her 2020 presidential campaign was economically and socially progressive.</p><p>Gabbard criticized the U.S. military's 2020 Baghdad International Airport airstrike (which killed high-level Iranian General Qasem Soleimani) as an act of war by President Trump and a violation of the U.S. Constitution, arguing that the president did not have Congressional authorization for this act.</p><p>In March 2019, Attorney General <a href=#>William Barr</a> asserted in his summary of the Mueller Report that the Special Counsel investigation had failed to find that members of Trump's 2016 campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government. In response, Gabbard commented that "finding the president of the United States not guilty of conspiring with a foreign power to interfere with our elections is a good thing for America." She subsequently reintroduced her election security bill, arguing that it would make foreign interference less likely in 2020.</p><p>On October 25, 2019, Gabbard announced that she would not seek reelection to the House in 2020, citing her presidential campaign. Hawaii State Senator <a href=#>Kai Kahele</a> had been challenging her for the Congressional seat. Kahele and the co-chair of his campaign, former Hawaii governor <a href=#>Neil Abercrombie</a> criticized her for missing votes while campaigning for president, especially the vote on Syria; however, her absences were similar to other members of Congress running for president.</p><p>On February 2, 2019, Gabbard officially launched her 2020 presidential campaign. CNN described her foreign policy platform as anti-interventionalist and her economic platform as populist.</p><p>Gabbard did not meet the polling threshold for the third presidential debate in time for the August 28 deadline. The following day, she criticized DNC's qualification criteria, saying that the DNC process of developing those criteria lacked transparency. On September 24, Gabbard qualified for the fourth debate in Ohio in October 2019 after gaining her fourth qualifying poll. In October, Gabbard accused the media and the Democratic party of "rigging" the 2020 election, and briefly threatened to boycott the fourth debate. On October 14, she announced in a letter to supporters that she would attend the debate.</p><p>On October 18, 2019, former Secretary of State and 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton was reported to have said that Russia was "grooming" a female Democrat to run as a third-party candidate who would help President Trump win reelection via a spoiler effect. The media understood Clinton to be referring to Gabbard, which Clinton spokesperson Nick Merril seemed to confirm to CNN, saying "If the nesting doll fits"; however, Gabbard has repeatedly said she will not run as a third-party candidate in 2020. Fellow 2020 Democratic presidential candidates Andrew Yang, <a href=#>Marianne Williamson</a>, <a href=#>Beto O'Rourke</a>, <a href=#>Pete Buttigieg</a>, <a href=#>John Delaney</a> and Bernie Sanders, as well as President Trump defended Gabbard and criticized Clinton's remarks. On January 22, 2020, Gabbard filed a defamation lawsuit against Clinton, seeking damages in excess of $50 million. On March 19, 2020, Gabbard dropped out of the 2020 election and endorsed Vice President Joe Biden.</p><p>On December 20, 2019, the Stop Arming Terrorists Act that she introduced in 2017 became law as part of National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020, § 1228 to prohibit the Department of Defense from "knowingly providing weapons or any other form of support to Al Qaeda" or other terrorist groups or any individual or group affiliated with any such organization.</p><p>Gabbard was a five-year "term member" of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). When asked about her involvement in it, she said that while many in CFR did not share her worldview, "If we only sit in rooms with people who we agree with, then we won’t be able to bring about the kind of change that we need to see."</p><p>Gabbard voted "present" when the House of Representatives voted to impeach President Trump in December 2019. In two video messages and a press release, she cited The Federalist Papers essay No. 69 and described her vote as a protest against "a political zero-sum game". Gabbard introduced H. Res. 766, which would censure Trump for several of his foreign policy decisions and "send a strong message to this president and future presidents that their abuses of power will not go unchecked, while leaving the question of removing Trump from office to the voters to decide." A week later, Gabbard said she had serious concern that the impeachment would increase the likelihood that her party would lose the presidential election and its majority in the House of Representatives.</p><p>On August 7, 2018, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported that the Hawaii Army National Guard had instructed Gabbard that a video of her in uniform on her VoteTulsi Facebook page did not comply with military ethics rules. Gabbard's campaign removed the video and added a disclaimer to the website's banner image of Gabbard in uniform in a veterans' cemetery that the image does not imply an endorsement from the military. A similar situation had happened during a previous Gabbard congressional campaign. A spokeswoman for Gabbard said the campaign would work closely with the Department of Defense to ensure compliance with all regulations.</p><p>In 2018, Gabbard introduced the "Securing America's Election Act", a bill to require all districts to use paper ballots, yielding an auditable paper trail in the event of a recount. Common Cause endorsed the bill.</p><p>Gabbard was reelected in November 2018, defeating Republican nominee <a href=#>Brian Evans</a> by 153,271 to 44,850 votes (77.4%–22.6%).</p><p>In September 2018, Gabbard and Representative <a href=#>Walter Jones</a> (R-NC) co-sponsored the No More Presidential Wars Act, an effort to "reclaim the responsibility Congress has to be the body that declares war, to end these presidential wars that are being fought without the authorization of Congress."</p><p>In 2017, Gabbard introduced the "Off Fossil Fuels (OFF) Act", which set a target of 2035 for transitioning the United States to renewable energy.</p><p>On January 18, 2017, Gabbard went on a one-week "fact-finding mission" to Syria and Lebanon, during which Gabbard met various political and religious leaders from Syria and Lebanon as well as regular citizens from both sides of the war, and also had two unplanned meetings with Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. In April 2017 Gabbard expressed skepticism about claims that Assad used chemical weapons against civilians in Khan Shaykhun and which were followed by a military attack against Syria by the United States. Gabbard said, "a successful prosecution of Assad (at the International Criminal Court) w[ould] require collection of evidence from the scene of the incident" and that she "support[ed] the United Nations’ efforts in this regard". In a 2018 interview with The Nation, Gabbard said the United States had "been waging a regime change war in Syria since 2011." Gabbard has called Assad "… a brutal dictator. Just like Saddam Hussein."</p><p>Along with Senator Hirono, Gabbard introduced a bill to award Filipino and Filipino American veterans who fought in World War II the Congressional Gold Medal. The bill passed Congress and was signed into law by Obama in December 2016.</p><p>Gabbard also introduced Talia's Law, to prevent child abuse and neglect on military bases. It was passed by Congress and signed into law by Obama in December 2016.</p><p>Gabbard was reelected on November 8, 2016, defeating Republican nominee Angela Kaaihue by 170,848 to 39,668 votes (81.2%–18.8%).</p><p>Gabbard resigned as DNC vice chair on February 28, 2016, in order to endorse Senator Bernie Sanders for the nomination for President of the United States. She was the first congresswoman to endorse Sanders and later gave the nominating speech putting his name forward at the 2016 Democratic National Convention.</p><p>In July 2016, Gabbard launched a petition to end the Democratic Party's process of appointing superdelegates in the nomination process. She endorsed Keith Ellison for DNC chair in the 2017 chairmanship elections.</p><p>Gabbard protested the construction of the final leg of the Dakota Access Pipeline in 2016.</p><p>Gabbard supports a national healthcare insurance program that covers uninsured as well as under-insured people and allows supplemental but not duplicative private insurance. She has called for addressing the national nursing shortage and supports clear GMO labeling, voting in 2016 against a GMO-labeling bill she said was too weak.</p><p>Gabbard was raised in part according to the teachings of the Science of Identity Foundation (SIF) religious community and its spiritual leader, <a href=#>Chris Butler</a>. She has said Butler's work still guides her. In 2015, Gabbard called Butler her guru dev (roughly, "spiritual teacher"). Gabbard's husband and ex-husband have also been part of the community. Gabbard has been reluctant to speak publicly about the SIF.</p><p>Gabbard is a recipient of the Combat Medical Badge and the Meritorious Service Medal. On October 12, 2015, she was promoted from captain to major at a ceremony at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific She continues to serve as a major in the Hawaii Army National Guard.</p><p>Following her public criticisms of the debate process, Gabbard was reported to have been either "disinvited" or asked to "consider not coming" to the October 13, 2015 Democratic debate in Las Vegas. In an interview with The New York Times, she spoke of an unhealthy atmosphere, saying, "no one told me I would be relinquishing my freedom of speech and checking it at the door" in taking the job. Gabbard privately wrote to Wasserman Schultz, accusing her of violating the DNC's duty of neutrality by favoring Hillary Clinton. This letter later became public in leaked emails published by WikiLeaks.</p><p>In 2015, Gabbard married freelance cinematographer and editor Abraham Williams, the son of her Honolulu office manager, in a traditional Vedic wedding ceremony, wearing blue silk.</p><p>On July 15, 2015, Gabbard received the Friend of the National Parks Award from the National Parks Conservation Association.</p><p>Gabbard was reelected on November 8, 2014, defeating Crowley again, by 142,010 to 33,630 votes (78.7%–18.6%); Libertarian candidate Joe Kent garnered 4,693 votes (2.6%).</p><p>On March 26, 2014, Elle magazine honored Gabbard, with others, at the Italian Embassy in the United States during its annual "Women in Washington Power List."</p><p>In March 2013, Gabbard introduced the Helping Heroes Fly Act, seeking to improve airport security screenings for severely wounded veterans. It passed Congress and was signed into law by President Barack Obama. She also introduced the house version of the Military Justice Improvement Act.</p><p>On January 22, 2013, Gabbard was unanimously elected to a four-year term as vice chair of the Democratic National Committee. In September 2015 she criticized chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz's decision to hold only six debates during the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries, compared with 26 in 2008 and 15 in 2004, and to exclude from all future DNC-sanctioned debates any candidate who participated in a non-DNC sanctioned debate. Gabbard released a statement about the debate controversy in a Facebook post in 2015:</p><p>Gabbard also criticized the Obama Administration, in more than 20 appearances on the Fox News network between 2013 and 2017, for "refusing" to say that the "real enemy" of the United States is "radical Islam" or "Islamic extremism."</p><p>Gabbard is vegan and, as a Hindu, follows Gaudiya Vaishnavism. She describes herself as a karma yogi. She values the Bhagavad Gita as a spiritual guide and took the oath of office in 2013 using her personal copy, which she gave to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a visit to India the following year.</p><p>On November 25, 2013, Gabbard received the John F. Kennedy New Frontier Award at a ceremony at the Institute of Politics at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government for her efforts on behalf of veterans.</p><p>As the Democratic nominee, Gabbard spoke at the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina at the invitation of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who called Gabbard "an emerging star." She won the November 6, 2012, general election, defeating Republican <a href=#>Kawika Crowley</a> by 168,503 to 40,707 votes (80.6%–19.4%), becoming the first Samoan-American and first Hindu member of Congress.</p><p>In December 2012, Gabbard applied to be considered for appointment to the U.S. Senate seat vacated by the death of <a href=#>Daniel Inouye</a>, but despite support from prominent mainland Democrats, she was not among the three candidates the Democratic Party of Hawaii selected.</p><p>In 2012, Gabbard apologized for her "anti-gay advocacy" and said she would "fight for the repeal" of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). In June 2013, she was an initial cosponsor of the legislation to repeal DOMA. After launching her presidential campaign in 2019, she apologized again and said that her views had been changed by her experience in the military "with LGBTQ service members both here at home and while deployed". She has been a member of the House LGBT Equality Caucus during her first, third, and fourth terms in Congress, and received a 100% rating in her third term (improving from 88% and 92% in her previous two terms) for pro-LGBT legislation from the Human Rights Campaign, a group that advocates for LGBT rights.</p><p>In early 2011, Mazie Hirono, the incumbent Democratic U.S. Representative for Hawaii's 2nd congressional district, announced that she would run for the United States Senate. In May 2011, Gabbard announced her candidacy for Hirono's House seat. The Democratic Mayor of Honolulu, <a href=#>Mufi Hannemann</a>, was the best-known candidate in the six-way primary, but Gabbard won with 62,882 votes (55%); the Honolulu Star-Advertiser called her win an "improbable rise from a distant underdog to victory." Gabbard resigned from the City Council on August 16 to focus on her congressional campaign and to prevent the cost of holding a special election.</p><p>In 2009, Gabbard graduated from Hawaii Pacific University with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with a concentration in International Business.</p><p>After returning home from her second deployment to the Middle East in 2009, Gabbard ran for a seat on the Honolulu City Council vacated by City Councilman Rod Tam, of the 6th district, who decided to retire in order to run for mayor of Honolulu. In the 10-candidate nonpartisan open primary in September 2010, Gabbard finished first with 33% of the vote. In the November 2 runoff election she defeated Sesnita Moepono, 58%–42%.</p><p>In March 2007, she graduated from the Accelerated Officer Candidate School at the Alabama Military Academy.

She co-sponsored the Family Act for paid family and medical leave and endorsed universal basic income. Until 2004 she voted and lobbied against same-sex marriage in Hawaii. She publicly apologized for that position in 2012. She apologized again after launching her presidential campaign in 2019. She opposes military interventionism and has called herself a "hawk" on terrorism. Her decision to meet Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and her skeptical approach to two claims that he had used chemical weapons were controversial.</p><p>In 2004, Gabbard volunteered for Army National Guard service in Iraq and chose not to campaign for reelection. Before her deployment to Iraq in 2004, she also worked as an educator for the Healthy Hawai'i Coalition.</p><p>In 2004, Gabbard filed for reelection but then volunteered for Army National Guard service in Iraq. <a href=#>Rida Cabanilla</a>, who filed to run against her, called on Gabbard to resign because she would not be able to represent her district from Iraq. Gabbard announced in August 2004 that she would not campaign for a second term, and Cabanilla won the Democratic primary, 64%–25%. State law prevented the removal of Gabbard's name from the ballot.</p><p>As a Hawaii state legislator in 2004, Gabbard argued against civil unions, saying, "To try to act as if there is a difference between 'civil unions' and same-sex marriage is dishonest, cowardly and extremely disrespectful to the people of Hawaii who have already made overwhelmingly clear our position on this issue... As Democrats we should be representing the views of the people, not a small number of homosexual extremists." She opposed Hawaii House Bill 1024, which would have established legal parity between same-sex couples in civil unions and married straight couples, and led a protest against the bill outside the room where the House Judiciary Committee held the hearing. The same year she opposed research on LGBT students and disputed that Hawaii schools were rampant with anti-gay discrimination.</p><p>In April 2003, while serving in the Hawaii State Legislature, Gabbard enlisted in the Hawaii Army National Guard. In July 2004, she was deployed for a 12-month tour in Iraq, serving as a specialist with the Medical Company, 29th Support Battalion, 29th Infantry Brigade Combat Team.

Gabbard then defeated Republican Alfonso Jimenez in the general election, 65%–35%.

She spoke on the organization's behalf as late as 2004 and called those seeking marriage equality "a small number of homosexual extremists."</p><p>In 1998, Gabbard supported her father's successful campaign to amend the Constitution of Hawaii to give lawmakers the power to limit marriage to opposite-sex couples. The Alliance for Traditional Marriage spent more than $100,000 opposing LGBT rights. In her campaign for the Hawaii legislature in 2002, Gabbard emphasized her role in getting a constitutional amendment passed that made same-sex marriage illegal in Hawaii and vowed to "bring that attitude of public service to the legislature".</p><p>Tulsi Gabbard (/ˈ t ʌ l s i ˈ ɡ æ b ər d / ; born April 12, 1981) is an American politician and Hawaii Army National Guard major who serves as the U.S. Representative for Hawaii's 2nd congressional district.
