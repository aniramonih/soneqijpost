The deployment of Russian-allied soldiers along the Suwalki corridor, on the other hand, would constitute an escalation that would frighten NATO and EU countries.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Despite its short length of 60 miles, the corridor is vitally essential to NATO, the EU, Russia, and Belarus.
