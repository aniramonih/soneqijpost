<span>Billy Koelling</span></p><h1>Wet Hot American Summer's Back! Relive the Movie's Star-Studded Scenes</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Ready for camp, Wet Hot American Summer fans? The cult comedy, from <strong>Michael Showalter </strong>and <strong>David Wain</strong>, is hitting Netflix as a rebooted prequel series on July 31, and the new show — Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp — is packed with even more famous faces than before.</p><p>The original film, about a group of counselors and their charges at a summer camp in the '80s, stars the likes of <strong>Amy Poehler</strong>, <strong>Bradley Cooper</strong>, <strong>Christopher Meloni</strong>, and <strong>Elizabeth Banks</strong>. The actors, whose quirky and subversive performances make Wet Hot American Summer the comedy legend that a devoted group knows and loves, have all become much bigger stars since the film's 2001 release.</p><p>Below, check out the core cast's best scenes to get in the mood for the First Day of Camp.</p><p><strong>Janeane Garofalo</strong></p><p>In this scene, Camp Firewood director Beth (<strong>Janeane Garofalo</strong>) introduces herself to Professor Henry Newman (<strong>David Hyde Peace</strong>) and asks if he'd like to teach science to her campers. His hilarious, shouty-caps response? "I SAID NO!" Classic Nils. Also, please note Beth's middle-parted braid tendrils.</p><p><strong>David Hyde Pierce</strong></p><p>So, turns out Professor Henry Newman has a huge secret: he isn't a professor… he's (gasp!) an associate professor. Watch Henry admit his biggest secret to a gaggle of nerds, and then weep copiously during a tender group hug.</p><p><strong>Michael Showalter</strong></p><p>This montage of Coop (Michael Showalter) and Gene (Christopher Meloni) dancing is basically the best thing that's happened to the film industry. Here's to praying that it's recreated in the Netflix series.</p><p><strong>Michael Ian Black</strong></p><p>In which McKinley Dozen (<strong>Michael Ian Black</strong>) is a huge pain about making plans to meet his fellow camp counselors 10 years in the future. Observe the short-shorts and tube socks. That is all.</p><p><strong>Paul Rudd</strong></p><p><strong>Paul Rudd</strong> plays Andy, Wet Hot American Summer's resident bro, and his performance is absolutely iconic. Every scene with Andy is a gem, but his cafeteria meltdown is next-level brilliant.</p><p><strong>Christopher Meloni</strong></p><p>Christopher Meloni's best known for playing Chris Keller on Oz and Elliot Stabler on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, but these guys have nothing on Gene. This army veteran is Camp Firewood's resident chef, and let's just say he has issues. Mostly related to sweater fondling.</p><p><strong>Molly Shannon</strong></p><p>Don't worry, it's just <strong>Molly Shannon</strong> yelling at a little girl because she made the mistake of asking for a colored marker. How dare you, small child?</p><p><strong>Ken Marino</strong></p><p>Picture this: <strong>Ken Marino</strong>, with an afro, wearing daisy dukes, and making out with a girl by the side of a van. Sound intriguing? Enjoy the clip.</p><p><strong>Joe Lo Truglio</strong></p><p><strong>Joe Lo Truglio</strong> is currently known for playing lovable foodie Detective Charles Boyle on Brooklyn Nine-Nine, but here he stars as mulleted camp counselor Neil in one of the most epic mock-motorcycle chase scenes ever.</p><p><strong>Amy Poehler</strong></p><p>Wet Hot American Summer came out the same year Poehler made her debut on Saturday Night Live, and it's easy to see why the folks at SNL hired her. She's hilarious as Type-A theater nerd Susie, and totally kills it in this scene alongside Bradley Cooper.</p><p><strong>Bradley Cooper</strong></p><p>Wet Hot American Summer was Bradley Cooper's film debut, and he plays a friendly, theater-loving camp counselor who happens to be gay. Check out his sweet wedding commitment ceremony, and pay special attention to Poehler's flute skills.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Elizabeth Banks</strong></p><p>While Elizabeth Banks' role was small in her third-ever movie, she did get to act alongside Rudd. In other words, she's blessed. This scene of Banks and Rudd chillin' at the lake is one of the movie's greatest.</p><p>Tell Us: What's your favorite WHAS celeb performance?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOsJytZZikwW6tzJ6popuRo3q0wcymnKurXZeupLeMq5yloaaaerW0xGakqK6ZmsBuv9OaqWarpKqxpbHDZqqcnZ6awG5%2Bj2psbGln</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./waverly-high-school-student-peyton-shaw-killed-and-others-injured-in-newfield-car-crash.html><span>←</span><span>Waverly High School student Peyton Shaw killed and others injured in Newfield car crash</span></a>
