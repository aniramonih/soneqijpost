One of his friends told <a href=#>Page Six</a> that Rock is "isn't even thinking of suing" because "he's focused on his tour" that's now sold out, thanks to #SlapGate.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Academy has launched a formal review of what happened, and will soon reveal its plans moving forward. "The Academy condemns the actions of Mr. Smith at last night's show," they said in a statement, per <a href=#>USA Today</a>. "We have officially started a formal review around the incident and will explore further action and consequences in accordance with our Bylaws, Standards of Conduct and California law."</p><p>What about Smith? He has been nothing but apologetic to the comedian. " I would like to publicly apologize to you, Chris. I was out of line and I was wrong. I am embarrassed and my actions were not indicative of the man I want to be," he said <a href=#>via a post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;one day after the Oscars. "I deeply regret that my behavior has stained what has been an otherwise gorgeous journey for all of us. I am a work in progress."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcWlnZoBxe9ahmK1lkaeybq%2FHq6CsZaKksKy%2FjK2fqK2XncG0ec6nZK2Zm567qHnLnp6apF2WsLW1zqdkmp%2BRnru0wIywoKWkXai6qsDHaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./walter-ray-williams-jr-career-legacy-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Walter Ray Williams JR: Career, Legacy &amp;amp; Net Worth</span></a>
