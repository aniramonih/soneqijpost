Anyway, Jenn Sherman is a Peloton instructor with quite the following, with her website offering live classes and pre-recorded classes which have all been incredibly popular.</p><p data-characters=272 data-current-count=642 data-injectable=true>Even the legendary director, Christopher Nolan has taken a few of her online classes which led to an awkward but hilarious viral moment in which Sherman criticized the film Tenet back in a 2020 pre-recorded class not knowing that Nolan would later take that exact class.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jenn Sherman (@pelotonjenn)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=667 data-injectable=true>Aside from famous directors, there are plenty of other people who take part in the rides and Sherman has gained quite the following thanks to her classes but also thanks to her ability to motivate and keep people entertained whilst keeping fit. Whilst her classes have started up again as of Jan. 23rd, fans of the fitness instructor want to know if everything is OK.</p><h2 id=h-why-did-jenn-sherman-stop-classes data-injectable=false>Why did Jenn Sherman stop classes?</h2><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=369 data-injectable=false>Sherman’s last live class was on November 28th last year and in total she was absent for eight weeks although she did remain active <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">on her Instagram account</a> where she addressed the situation on January 1st. In two videos posted to her story Sherman explained that she had been dealing with medical issues, although she didn’t specify what exactly those issues were.</p><p data-characters=425 data-current-count=794 data-injectable=true>Whilst some pre-recorded classes were made available there were no live ones for people to follow along with. She did assure fans that her condition was nothing to worry about, she still posted frequently to her Instagram during these eight weeks so it seems that whatever the issue was it wasn’t life-threatening. However, Sherman did say in her story that her doctor had advised against returning to classes at that time.</p><p>I’m going to be perfectly 100% fine. But unfortunately I don’t have the green light to be back on the Bike yet.</p><h2 id=h-jenn-sherman-s-return data-injectable=false>Jenn Sherman’s return</h2><p data-characters=328 data-current-count=446 data-injectable=true>Live classes started up again on Tuesday this week. In a video posted on Instagram she expressed her joy at being back on the bike. Although it doesn’t seem like she’s going to answer fans’ questions regarding her medical condition, which is fair enough, the important thing to remember is that she’s better now.</p><p data-characters=221 data-current-count=221 data-injectable=false>Either way, it’s great to see her finally able to get back to doing what she loves and fans are more than happy to have her back too, I’m sure Christopher Nolan is also relieved to see her back on the peloton as well.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZp%2BaqKCau6awjK2mZqKVo7tuv8eeqaaZnmQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-fuerza-regida-security-member-dies-after-vehicle-attack-news.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened to Fuerza Regida?
