He was the only <a href=# rel=noopener>child of his mother and father</a>, who came to Canada from another country.</p><p>June, his mother, is from Hangzhou, China, and Robert, his father, is from Edinburgh, Scotland. So, the <a href=# rel=noopener>reality star</a> is a Canadian citizen from a mixed-race background.</p><p>So, the mix of traditional and western has always been an important part of his life. His parents give him full freedom to be who he wants to be, but they also teach him some values.</p><p>His mother moved to <a href=# rel=noopener>Hong Kong</a> after he had grown up in Hangzhou. After they moved to Canada in the late 1980s to marry his <a href=# rel=noopener>Scottish father</a>, who was 26 years older than her, Abbie was born.</p><p>Blake’s father gave him a sense of security, belief, and confidence, which made it seem like their <a href=# rel=noopener>relationship was almost unique before his death</a> in late 2020.</p><p>Robert “Bob” Alexander Abbie was born around the middle of June 1934, which means he probably spent a lot of his <a href=# rel=noopener>early years</a> in fear because of WWII (1939–45).</p><p>Even though he left his mark on the world, he and his family did well in the years that followed through hard work, dedication, and a <a href=# rel=noopener>little bit</a> of luck.</p><p>As a young adult, he moved from his home country of Scotland to Canada to <a href=# rel=noopener>play professional soccer</a>. He then worked for a company in the 1960s to further his career.</p><p>Unfortunately, it’s not clear where Robert went from there, but Blake has made it clear that his father wore many hats in his 86 years.</p><p>In other words, it seems like Robert has always had enough money to take care of his <a href=# rel=noopener>family and pursue his interests</a> without having to worry too much about money.</p><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;Joe Dempsie (GOT Actor) Bio, Age, Height, Relationship, Affairs, Net Worth 2023, Controversy and More</strong></p><h2>Blake Abbie: Married Life</h2><p>We <a href=# rel=noopener>don’t know</a> if Blake and Abbie are dating or not because we don’t have enough information.
