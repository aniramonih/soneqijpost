Though he has become very popular for these cartoons, it was a Twitter thread about a haunting he was experiencing back in 2017 that brought him real attention.</p><p data-characters=313 data-current-count=313 data-injectable=false>Back in August, Ellis moved into a new apartment and started having dreams about a boy that he found out to be called “Dear David”. Trying to brush off these dreams as simply nighttime mind wanderings, Ellis found he couldn’t as more and more weird happenings led him to feel unsafe in his home.</p><p data-characters=321 data-current-count=634 data-injectable=true>Having first seen the boy, with a crushed skull (which he illustrated) in a dream one night, he was told in a later dream by a little girl that the boy’s name was “Dear David” and you could ask him two questions. The only condition was that he began with “Dear David” (much like Simon Says).</p><p data-characters=149 data-current-count=149 data-injectable=false>She warned him against asking a third question though, telling him “But never try to ask him a third question, or he’ll kill you.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=449 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Then she added, "But never try to ask him a third question, or he'll kill you."</p>— Adam Ellis (@adamtotscomix) <a href=#>August 7, 2017</a></figure><p data-characters=141 data-current-count=141 data-injectable=false>Ellis asked his two questions in the next dream he had of David, but, forgetting this rule, asked a third question only to wake up screaming.</p><h2 id=h-what-happened-after-adam-ellis-asked-dear-david-the-third-question data-injectable=false>What happened after Adam Ellis asked Dear David the third question?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=441 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>What is going on? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/30mLSqYhXo</a></p>— Adam Ellis (@adamtotscomix) <a href=#>August 9, 2017</a></figure><p data-characters=364 data-current-count=364 data-injectable=false>The irregular dreams and sleep paralysis didn’t occur all the time, but other things started happening in the illustrator’s apartment that added to his discomfort. After moving to the apartment upstairs, he thought he might be safe, but his two cats would congregate by the front door leading to the hallway every night at midnight and just meow at it.</p><p data-characters=287 data-current-count=651 data-injectable=true>Then he started recording sounds on his phone using a sound app, only to hear a weird unexplained static sound at three AM every morning. It soon graduated to calls from an unknown caller to nanny cam recordings of things, including that first rocking chair, moving of their own accord.</p><p data-characters=399 data-current-count=399 data-injectable=false>Ellis was, rightly so, getting more and more scared of what would happen next, until one November night, he was struck by sleep paralysis as David appeared once more in his room. During this encounter, he took pictures before falling back to sleep, but the next morning was shocked by what he saw in his gallery (you really do need to turn up your brightness and look at them in a dark environment).</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=699 data-injectable=true><p lang=zxx dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ryWZZozRr6</a></p>— Adam Ellis (@adamtotscomix) <a href=#>November 7, 2017</a></figure><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=307 data-injectable=false>Ellis would continue to capture images of “Dear David” with some of them showing the ghoul pretty clearly, as well as make new revelations such as finding out there was a huge crawlspace above his apartment. Upon inspecting the hatch that led to it, he found a small shoe and a very old marble.</p><p data-characters=254 data-current-count=561 data-injectable=true>The tweets from Ellis would start to taper off close to January of 2018, with the illustrator having to assure those following him that he was fine and had not been murdered by the little ghost boy in the night. You can read the whole thread on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wakelet</a>.</p><p data-characters=127 data-current-count=127 data-injectable=false>The story left many freaked out (I remember reading this myself, very stupidly, alone at night and being reasonably petrified).</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=427 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>The next one was worse.

The story garnered Ellis over one million new followers, so obviously his employers at BuzzFeed saw this as a bankable opportunity.</p><h2 id=h-dear-david-film-adaptation-release-date-cast-and-more data-injectable=false>Dear David film adaptation release date, cast, and more</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=543 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=329 data-current-count=329 data-injectable=false>The story has now been made into a movie starring Augustus Prew (The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, High Rise) as Ellis. The story has changed a little, with “Dear David” now originating as a Twitter account that first makes contact with Ellis after he goes to war with a troll on the social media platform.</p><p data-characters=182 data-current-count=511 data-injectable=true>The upcoming horror film has created a backstory to David as well, with the character of Ellis setting out to discover more about the strange boy who keeps visiting him in the night.</p><p data-characters=138 data-current-count=138 data-injectable=false>Unsurprisingly the film will be a co-production between BuzzFeed Studios and Lionsgate. Justin Long and Andrea Bang will also star in it.</p><p data-characters=194 data-current-count=332 data-injectable=false>For all those who got caught up on the thread, Dear David will be released on Oct. 13, a fitting day for a horror release given that that date lands on a Friday… making it Friday the 13th.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGZpGK2tHnToZxmmZSWum6xy6WgrGWUmq6zecOaraKcXanEqsDTnqlmq6Skv7p7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tamara-anna-cislowska-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>What is Tamara Anna Cislowska Net Worth 2024: Wiki, Real Name, Age, Height, Family And More</span></a>
