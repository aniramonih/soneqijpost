In 1995, a judge overturned his conviction, citing prosecutorial misconduct. Prosecutors had (wrongly) argued that George Franklin's decision to remain silent when questioned about the case (essentially exercising his Fifth Amendment rights),was tantamount to a confession, per the&nbsp;<a href=#>National Registry of Exonerations</a>. There was also a reexamination of why the judge in Franklin's trial didn't allow his defense lawyer to argue that Eileen's knowledge of the crimes could've been based on news coverage of the case as opposed to true repressed memory.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>It all turned upside down when Eileen also pinned two additional murders on her father. DNA evidence in those cases matched to another suspect, immediately casting doubt on Eileen's initial claims against George Franklin in the Nason case.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCCkXJpcW9frLWmvsRmoKxllZ65prHNZp2rmZ6guaq60madmqyYmr9us8SoqaCdXam8pa3YaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-makes-the-masters-golf-tournament-unique.html><span>←</span><span>What Makes the Masters Golf Tournament Unique?</span></a>
