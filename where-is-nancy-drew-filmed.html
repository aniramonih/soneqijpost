The CW’s Nancy Drew series is a new take on Edward Stratemeyer's 1930s thrill-seeking character. The mystery drama is centered around Nancy (Kennedy McMann), as she solves both supernatural and earthbound mysteries in her haunted hometown of Horseshoe Bay, Maine. The foggy, mystical town is almost as much of a character as Nancy is."><meta name=author content="Patria Henriques"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
