Boston Red Sox Right Fielder Was Adopted At 5 Months</h1></header><section class=post-content><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.medadmbjmc.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Rob-Refsnyder.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><strong>On June 10, 2022, the Red Sox signed baseball player Rob Refsnyder, who is Korean-American. This put him on the 40-man roster and moved him as far as the main leagues.</strong></p><p>He has played for the Minnesota Twins, Texas Rangers, New York Yankees, Toronto Blue Jays, and Tampa Bay Rays in Major League Baseball.</p><p>At Laguna Hills High School, he was successful in three different sports. After high school, he went to the University of Arizona for college. There, he played right field for the Arizona Wildcats baseball team.</p><p>Refsnyder was chosen as the CWS Most Outstanding Player after helping the Arizona Wildcats baseball team win the College World Series in 2012.</p><h2>Rob Refsnyder Father Clint and Mother Jane are his parents</h2><p>Rob Refsnyder is a trained baseball player who was born as Kim Jung-Tae in Seoul, South Korea.</p><p>Jane and Clint Refsnyder, who are from Laguna Hills, California, and have German and Irish roots, took him in when he was 5 months old. They did this through Holt International Children’s Services. “Muhlenberg College” was the name of the school where his dad used to play basketball.</p><p>Rob’s dad always tells him to make things as easy as possible for himself in competitions. Rob and his dad would often go to watch the Los Angeles Lakers play in the National Basketball Association on Christmas Day.</p><p>Rob’s parents brought home a daughter from South Korea three years before Rob was born. She went by the name Elizabeth. The only other thing we know about his parents is that they stay out of the spotlight.</p><h2>Rob Refsnyder’s wife, Monica Drake, is here</h2><p>Monica Drake is an All-American swimmer who qualified for the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics through the US Olympic trials. She is married to Rob Refsnyder.</p><p>They met for the first time in 2012 at the University of Arizona, where they were both students. In December 2015, the couple got married. Rob and Monica have a son, who they raise together as a family. Their son was born in 2021.</p><p>Rob is thought to be an honest and good person outside of work. He worked with Athletes Brand to make a T-shirt that could help A Kid’s Place, a charity that helps foster children in the Tampa Bay area, raise money. He also wants to learn more about Korean culture and the language. He plans to go to South Korea with his sister.</p><p>Rob Refsnyder comes from two completely different races. In 1991, when he was only 5 months old, a major league baseball player was adopted. Kim Jung-Tae is his given name.</p><p>About his real mother, only her age and where she went to high school are known, and Refsnyder doesn’t have anything bad to say about her.</p><p>His mother, Jane Refsnyder, knows every date of the adoption process off the top of her head. Adoptive parents make appointments with social workers to talk about their finances and go through legal background checks, just like pregnant women do for ultrasounds, diabetes tests, and trimesters.</p><p>There are times when parents have to give up things before they even meet their children. His father tried to get him to play baseball. In Major League Baseball, he plays second base and correct space for the Boston Red Sox. Even though he played in the MLB for the first time in 2015, the Yankees did not use him very much.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrHDmpummpqisG%2B1zWiuoaddlr%2BmedGomWaqlZvAr8XDnqlmqJGnsq%2FA0maapaGeqXqiusNmoZqmlWJ%2FcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jeffrey-dean-morgan-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>What is Jeffrey Dean Morgan's Net Worth?
