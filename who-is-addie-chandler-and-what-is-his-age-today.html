He recently made a lot of waves as the voice behind the character, Devon, in Turning Red (2022). Addie Chandler’s current age is very uncertain as he has not made his date of birth public yet, however, it is widely assumed that he was born between 2004 and 2007.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Addie Chandler’s Bio</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name:</strong> Addison Chandler</li><li><strong>Nickname:</strong> Addie</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Male</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> Mixed Caucasian</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</li><li><strong>Current Residence:</strong> Los Angeles, California, United States of America</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong> Straight</li><li><strong>Religion:</strong> Christianity</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Single</li><li><strong>Addie Chandler’s Height in Inches:</strong> 5 feet 8 inches</li><li><strong>Addie Chandler’s Height in Centimeters:</strong> 173 cm</li><li><strong>Addie Chandler’s Weight:</strong> 65 kg (143 lbs)</li><li><strong>Eye Color:</strong> Blue</li><li><strong>Hair Color:</strong> Blonde</li><li><strong>Addie Chandler’s Net Worth:</strong> Est. between $250k – $400k</li><li><strong>Famous for:</strong> Being a voice actor</li></ul><h2><strong>How Old Is Addie Chandler?</strong></h2><p>In spite of the fact that the voice actor has gained a lot of traction career-wise in the media and the public, Addie Chandler’s exact date of birth is currently unknown to the public. Every indication points to the fact that as of 2022, he is in his mid to late teenage years. A lot of publications operate on the assumption that he was born between 2004 – 2007.</p><p>Based on that assumption, Addie Chandler could be either 19 or 16 years old at this time. He is an American citizen, having been born in the United States of America, and currently lives in Los Angeles, California with his family but he has not explicitly revealed his exact place of birth.</p><p>There has also been no verifiable information with regards to the identities of Addie Chandler’s parents, including what they do for a living. In the same manner, it would also appear that Addie Chandler is the only child of his family because the actor who is quite secretive about such matters has yet to say if he has siblings or not.</p><h2><strong>Addie Chandler Attended Acting School</strong></h2><p>Addie Chandler’s love for acting at a very young age convinced his very supportive parents to enroll him in an acting school so that he will properly be equipped to pursue his dream as an actor. His progress since that ingenious idea from his parents is yielding satisfying dividends today.</p><p>Other aspects of his formal education include the fact that he attended a local high school at first before his progress at the unnamed institution was derailed by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. However, due to the fact that he was determined to continue his studies in spite of the challenges, the voice actor has since pursued his academic aspirations through an online school specially designed for child and teen actors.</p><p>He is yet to receive his high school diploma at the time of writing this article.</p><h2><strong>Addie Chandler Began Acting Before He Turned 10 Years Old</strong></h2><p>The mystery surrounding the young American voice actor’s date of birth means that it is almost impossible to determine the exact age at which he began acting. Without ruling out the possibility of that very important detail changing and working with the assumption that he was born between 2004 and 2007, it is safe to assume that Addie Chandler was around 6 and 9 years old when he officially made his screen debut in 2013.</p><p>Whichever may be the case, the fact that he was most definitely less than 10 years old at the time is a credit to the actor’s abilities at such a very young age. His first official credit came in the TV series titled Outside The Box as Danny in the episode titled The Shining.</p><p>Three years after his debut, Addie followed his performance in Outside The Box with a resounding voicing of the character Otto/Notto Prince in the 2016 short movie Barbie: Dreamtopia. The following year he reprised his voice role in the short movie’s sequel, Barbie Dreamtopia: Festival of Fun.</p><h2><strong>He is Most Famous For Voicing Three Characters in Harvey Beaks</strong></h2><p>It is a well-known fact that every actor or actress has that one role that marks the turning point of his or her career. For Addie Chandler, that aura of prominence hit when he voiced the characters Rooter, Roger, and Elves in Greenblatt’s animated series Harvey Beaks. This all happened over 6 episodes of the series between 2016 to 2017.</p><p>From 2017 to 2018, Addie returned to voice what has become an iconic character for him, Otto/Notto Prince in the TV series of Barbie Dreamtopia. Over the years, Addie Chandler has appeared in several other movies and TV series, including Colin in Black and White, The Loud House, American Horror Story, We Bare Bears, and most recently in the just-released Turning Red.</p><p>Below is a bullet list of the actor’s movie and TV series credits:</p><h3><strong>Addie Chandler’s TV Series</strong></h3><ul><li>2013 – Outside The Box as Danny (1 ep)</li><li>2016-2017 – Harvey Beaks as Rooter/Roger/Elves (6 eps)</li><li>2017-2018 – Barbie Dreamtopia as Otto/Notto Prince (12 eps)</li><li>2018 – The Loud House as Big Kid (1 ep)</li><li>2018 – American Horror Story as Boy (1 ep)</li><li>2018-2019 – We Bare Bears as Badger/Additional voices (2 eps)</li></ul><h3><strong>Addie Chandler’s Short Movies</strong></h3><ul><li>2016 – Barbie: Dreamtopia as Otto/Notto Prince</li><li>2017 – Barbie Dreamtopia: Festival of Fun as Otto/Notto Prince</li></ul><h3><strong>Addie Chandler’s Movie(s)</strong></h3><ul><li>2022 – Turning Red as Devon</li></ul><h3><strong>TV Mini-Series</strong></h3><ul><li>2021 – Colin in Black & White as Student #1 (1 ep)</li></ul><h2><strong>How Tall Is Addie Chandler?</strong></h2><p>When one considers the fact that Addie Chandler is around 18 years old, his height of 5 feet 8 inches (173 cm or 1.73m) becomes even more impressive. He also currently weighs around 65kg (143lbs) even though he does not look that muscular.</p><p>All that statistics are most likely going to change over time as he gets older and perhaps more muscular. Two things that are unlikely to change though are his classic Caucasian blue eyes and blonde hair.</p><h3><strong>Addie Chandler Has No Verifiable Social Media Presence</strong></h3><p>It would appear that Addie Chandler is not actively involved on Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, TikTok, or any other social media platform. This particular development comes as a big surprise due to the fact that he is still quite young and at an age where every young person of his age seems to be actively involved on at least one social media platform.</p><p>However, like almost every other detail of the actor, he might reconsider his position on the matter as time goes on.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunDDx6hkoqtdlrGltcRmmqGZnpm5pr6MmqWdZaedrrV5yKxkoaGjYq6osYytpp2ZqWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marisa-tomei-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>What is Marisa Tomei Net Worth 2024: A Financial Breakdown</span></a>
