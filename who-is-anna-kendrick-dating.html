The couple — who met in 2017 on the set of the <a href=#>Disney Plus</a> original film Noelle together — were notoriously private about their romance.</p><p>But it appears that neither party will have to keep their relationship hidden from the public eye any longer: In late June 2022, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a> reported that Anna and Bill officially broke up.</p><p>No further details regarding their split have been revealed at this time, but the news comes just two months after the <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a> alum shut down rumors that Anna would appear on his acclaimed HBO dark comedy series, <a href=#>Barry</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Can't believe Anna Kendrick and Bill Hader split up!

They have a really fun rapport, very sarcastic and funny but all coming from a place of love," the source said. "You'd think she'd be the one kind of running the show, but she's pretty quiet around him."</p><p>"They're affectionate but it's the way they look at one another when the other is talking, you can see they really love each other."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Anna Kendrick previously dated Edgar Wright and Ben Richardson.</h2><p>Prior to Bill, Anna dated filmmaker Edgar Wright.
