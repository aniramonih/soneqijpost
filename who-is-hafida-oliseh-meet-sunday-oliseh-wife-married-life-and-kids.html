Meet Sunday Oliseh Wife: Married Life And Kids</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Sunday Oliseh Wife</strong> is being sought after after the footballer said on Monday that the Qatar World Cup is “the greatest tournament” Africa “has ever experienced.” Sunday Oliseh is a Nigerian football manager and former professional player. He is presently the head coach of the Nigerian national team, a post he has held since 2016.</p><p>He started his football career as a young player at Jos Football Academy before moving on to play professionally for teams in Nigeria, Belgium, and Germany. He played over 100 games for Nigeria and was a key member of the squad that won the African Cup of Nations in 1994.</p><h2>Who Is Hafida Oliseh, Sunday Oliseh’s Wife? Do They have children?</h2><p><strong>Sunday Oliseh</strong> married his stunning Moroccan wife, <strong>Hafidah Oliseh</strong>, on Sunday, just after the 1994 FIFA World Cup. The lovely couple has been married for many years and has two lovely children, a boy and a girl. Sunday Oliseh’s wife, Mrs. Hafidah, is not a Nigerian, even though they have been married for many years. The former midfielder’s personal life has remained mainly private, and little is known about his marriage. Several stunning images, however, illustrate her innate beauty.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Sunday-Oliseh-1.jpg alt="Sunday Oliseh" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>On Sunday, the Atlas Lions of Morocco delivered one of the best performances of the FIFA World Cup, upsetting World Number 2 Belgium to win Group F.&nbsp;His achievements in the 1996 Olympics and the 1998 World Cup cannot be exaggerated; he will be remembered for his outstanding performance in the 1998 World Cup.</p><h2>Sunday Oliseh’s Parents: Who Are They?</h2><p><strong>Sunday Oliseh</strong> of Ogochukwu is the second son of Mr. and Mrs. Oliseh and was born into a Catholic family.&nbsp;When he was little, his father was a goaltender, but he shattered his hand, ending his playing career.&nbsp;He opted to finish his education and enrolled at Amadu Bello University to pursue a degree in accountancy. Oliseh’s mother is a former entrepreneur who has since retired.&nbsp;Sunday’s father hoped for him to follow in the footsteps of his father and become an accountant.</p><p>He forbade him from participating in football since he knew no one who benefitted from it. When he arrived home and saw him playing football, he spanked him.&nbsp;Sunday’s life changed when he earned his first payment from his school’s local club.&nbsp;He carried all of the money home and gave it to his father, who was surprised and invited his siblings to a party.&nbsp;According to him, your brother is paid more than I was as an accountant. He then started to believe in his son and give him his full support.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Sunday-Oliseh-2.jpg alt="Sunday Oliseh" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Sunday Oliseh’s Current Net Worth</h2><p><strong>Sunday Oliseh</strong> is worth around $150,000,000 as a football manager in Nigeria, Belgium, and other countries across the globe.&nbsp;Oliseh is reported to have amassed considerable riches throughout his playing career.&nbsp;Nonetheless, his FIFA disagreement seems to have taken a toll on his finances to the point that he was forced to launch a GoFundMe website to handle the FIFA life ban trial that was placed on him at the time.&nbsp;Sunday Oliseh’s international salary as a coach is in the six digits. In Belgium, a coach makes an average of 5,000,000 per month before benefits.</p><p><strong>Sunday Oliseh’s net worth</strong> should be clear from this.&nbsp;Oliseh has two homes in Lagos and one in Delta State. All three houses are two stories tall.&nbsp;He drives a 2016 Nissan Altima and a 2015 Jeep Liberty. Oliseh recently bought a 2018 Toyota Highlander for use in Nigeria on Sunday.&nbsp;The three-bedroom house Oliseh got as a gift from the Muhammad Buhari government for his participation in the Super Eagles team that won the African Cup of Nations in Tunisia in 1994 was one he couldn’t keep concealed from the public.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddnsButMCfoJ2ZXaS5qr%2FEoWSmnZWperTBzZ2YsmWfoba0scdmrqKelWK6or7RopydZZyes6Z5wKebZqOZmcBw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-clare-crawleys-boyfriend-ryan-dawkins-what-to-know.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Clare Crawley's Boyfriend Ryan Dawkins?
