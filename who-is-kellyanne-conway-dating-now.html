Ever since her marriage with American lawyer and activist George Conway ended, the political consultant has been keeping a low profile on her personal life.</strong></p><p>Kellyanne Conway is a 56 year-old American political consultant and pollster who served as Senior Counselor to the President in the administration of Donald Trump from 2017 to 2020. Her ex-husband is an accomplished and outspoken lawyer. The former couple were married for 22 years. Since the end of their marriage, Kellyanne has reportedly been living her best life and is not ready to date yet. Here’s more to know.</p><h2><strong>Is Kellyanne Conway Still Married?</strong></h2><p>Kellyanne Conway is no longer married. She was previously married to George Conway, an American lawyer and activist. The ex-couple was married from 2001 to 2023. Their love story began back in the 1990s when George spotted Kellyanne on the cover of a magazine and called his friend Ann Coulter to introduce them. Coulter did just that, and they soon started dating.</p><p>After a couple of years, they got married in 2001 in Philadelphia at the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul. The ceremony was said to be a “decadent affair,” and significantly, their wedding cake was so big that it had to be cut into pieces for it to fit in the door. Kellyanne and her husband lived peacefully for about 17 years, which followed their marriage, and raised their children together.</p><p>Their union produced four children: twins named Claudia and George IV, Charlotte, and Vanessa. While George worked in New York as a litigation attorney, Kellyanne’s polling job had her working in both New York and Washington, DC. While they were maintaining success in their individual careers, the couple were also trying to keep it afloat on the home front and supported each other in any way they could.</p><p>“I couldn’t have done this without him,” Kellyanne once said of her husband taking care of the kids while she was away campaigning.</p><h2><strong>She Got Divorced From Her Husband, George Conway, After 22 Years of Marriage</strong></h2><p>However, trouble came into the seeming paradise when Kellyanne Conway and her husband, George, started to be increasingly at odds with each other over Kellyanne’s boss, former president Donald Trump. She worked as a top adviser to Donald Trump. While speaking to the Post, Kellyanne said that she feels there is a part of George that thinks she chose Donald Trump over him, which she finds ridiculous.</p><p>“One is my work and one is my marriage and I feel torn between the two of them,” Kellyanne said. On his own part, George Conway said that he is just saddened at how things turned out. “If there’s an issue, it’s because she’s in that job, for that man,” George said while speaking to the Post. Since 2018, their marriage has remained a subject of media attention.</p><h3><strong>What Caused Kellyanne Conway’s Divorce?</strong></h3><p>As a matter of fact, Kellyanne and her husband started having issues in their marriage after George turned down Trump’s offer to run the Justice Department’s civil division or serve as US Solicitor General. According to reports, George did not want to be part of a Justice Department that found itself targeted by the president.</p><p>After he rejected the offer, he began to take shots at Trump on social media, on one occasion posting that Trump was mentally unstable, corrupt, and unfit for office. All this led to a tense relationship with his wife, and things got to a fever point when Kellyanne began to defend Trump publicly. She once described George’s tweet about her boss as “disrespectful and a violation of basic decency”.</p><p>Trump, on his part, simply capped off the whole drama and called Geroge “A total loser, a stone cold LOSER & husband from hell”. Meanwhile, Kellyanne Conway explained that the rift between her husband and her boss does not in any way affect her job because Trump “left it alone for months out of respect for me.”</p><p>In September 2019, Kellyanne, who was known to be attending events together with her husband, was seen at the State dinner alone. It was also at the same time noticed that both of them had stopped wearing their wedding rings. It, therefore, was unsurprising to the public when in August 2020, Kellyanne announced their separation, citing “irreconcilable differences”.</p><p>In her 2022 biography, Kellyanne Conway gave an insight into some of the marital difficulties she experienced as a result of her and her husband’s differing political views. Ultimately, Kellyanne Conway and her husband, George Conway, announced in March 2023 that they are going through an amicable divorce and are in the final stages of it. They added that regardless of their divorce, they will remain united as parents to their children.</p><h2><strong>Who Was Kellyanne Conway Married To?</strong></h2><p>Kellyanne Conway was married to George Conway, and the marriage was her first and only marriage so far. George Conway is a 60 year-old American lawyer and activist born on 2nd September 1963 in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S. George is famous in his own right although his marriage to Kellyanne Conway relatively gave him more recognition in the limelight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/George.png><p>He graduated from Harvard College magna cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in biochemistry in 1984 and obtained his Juris Doctor from Yale Law School in 1987. Upon graduation, George served as a law clerk to Judge Ralph K. Winter Jr. of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. He joined the law firm of Wachtell, Rosen, Lipton, and Katz in September 1988, where he handled all his cases perfectly.</p><p>George Conway was one of the lawyers who represented Paula Jones in her sexual harassment suit against Bill Clinton. He was previously an attorney general but later withdrew. One of his notable cases was against National Australia Bank on 19th March 2010, which was ultimately won by an 8-0 vote of the court. Even though George Conway initially supported Trump for president, he would soon become one of his fiercest critics, openly opposing and criticizing his work and policies.</p><h2><strong>Does Kellyanne Conway Have a Boyfriend?</strong></h2><p>Kellyanne Conway currently does not have a boyfriend and has not been romantically linked with or speculated to be involved with any man since August 2020, when she got separated from her husband, George.</p><p>In fact, Kellyanne has intentionally refrained from disclosing any information that has to do with her personal life to the public or the media. The mother of four seems to be focusing on her career for now and raising her children, whom she got custody.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571KxmsKCfYra0ecqeo6WxkaO7pnnCqKWwmalisaLAyKeeZqafrHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-joey-hamilton-dating-now-a-look-into-the-tattoo-artists-relationship-history-html.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Joey Hamilton Dating Now?
