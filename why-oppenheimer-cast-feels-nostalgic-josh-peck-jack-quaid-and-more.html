They can’t speak. I mean, there’s an element of fear that’s there in the history and there in the underpinnings. But the love of the characters, the love of the relationships, is as strong as I’ve ever done,” the director told Wired in June 2023. “I showed it to a filmmaker recently who said it’s kind of a horror movie. I don’t disagree. As I started to finish the film, I started to feel this color that’s not in my other films, just darkness. It’s there. The film fights against that.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Since its release, Oppenheimer has continued to be critically-acclaimed for the performances from the film’s cast.</p><p>Scroll down for every Oppenheimer actor who might have left a lasting impression in your childhood:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Bstbp5zqmnnqaYmrausdFmmpqrpGKzprHLrGSnp6Oprq2zyJxko6ejnXqxscKkZKOZk6B6ssHAoptmmZ6Zeq670Z5m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-is-micah-morris-leaving-good-good-wife-katie-morris-and-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Why Is Micah Morris Leaving Good Good?
