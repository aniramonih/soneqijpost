However, after he drew some laughs by ad-libbing a joke on-air while working on a broadcasting course, he decided to focus on comedy.</li><li>As he had shown the negative side of the show business in his childhood with his father often remaining away from home for long periods of time and not earning a steady income, he was determined not to work in the show business and instead find a steady paying job.</li><li>While studying in high school, he excelled in sports. He served as a&nbsp;captain of the basketball team, played as a kicker in&nbsp;the school’s varsity&nbsp;football&nbsp;team, and was also a member of the soccer team.</li><li>While in the senior year at the high school, he used to get along with his friend to perform comedy skits over the intercom system. He also used to regularly create comedy skits for the talent shows held in the school.</li><li>While studying at the university, he secured an internship&nbsp;at a local television station in the sports department. However, he didn’t enjoy his work.</li><li>After graduating from the university, he started working as a hotel valet. But he didn’t last long in his job because of his mistakes. In fact, he drove a van under a low-lying beam, which resulted in a baggage rack being torn off the top of the vehicle.</li><li>After his failure as a hotel valet, he started working as a teller at Wells Fargo. However, his careless and error-prone work ethic again came to fore as he often came up short on money deposited with him.</li><li>His mother noticed how he was floundering at various jobs and encouraged him to go for something that he liked. He decided to audition&nbsp;for the comedy group&nbsp;The Groundlings and he was accepted.</li><li>With his diligent work and impressive skills, he managed to secure a place&nbsp;with the top professional group of The Groundlings in 1994.</li><li>In 1995, the producer of&nbsp;Saturday Night Live&nbsp;saw the performance of&nbsp;The Groundlings. He was impressed with Ferrell’s work and he asked him&nbsp;to audition for&nbsp;<a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Lorne Michaels</a>, the main producer of SNL.</li><li>He joined the cast of SNL in 1995. He worked in the popular comedy sketch show for 7 years before leaving the show in 2002. However, he has worked as a host and guest in the show on numerous occasions.</li><li>In January 2016, it was revealed that Ferrell was set to become a part-owner of the new Major League Soccer team, Los Angeles FC. The club made its MLS debut in March 2018.</li><li>In April 2018, he was caught in a serious accident involving two cars. He was riding with three passengers in the SUV, which flipped over. He escaped without any serious injuries.</li><li>In 2005, the Premiere Magazine placed him on the 38th spot in their Power 50 list. The following year, he improved his ranking and finished in the 34th spot.</li><li>In recognition of his services to the entertainment industry, he was honored with his&nbsp;star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6767 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood.</li><li>In April 2007, he collaborated with <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Adam McKay</a>&nbsp;to start a streaming video website, Funny or Die. The users can upload short films on the website and other users were allowed to vote on posted videos.</li><li>In December 2021, Will was honored with the “Courage to Care” award at the 2021 Maestro Cares Gala.</li><li>He doesn’t have any official social media account.</li><p>Featured Image by&nbsp;Eva Rinaldi / <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Flickr</a> / CC BY-SA 2.0</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jrCgpaRdm7KzvsSlo2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-lottie-powdrell-israel-adesanya-rumored-girlfriend-wiki-and-instagram-are.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Lottie Powdrell?
