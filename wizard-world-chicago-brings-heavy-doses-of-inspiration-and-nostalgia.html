Fans also got a one of a kind look at the upcoming sci-fi film Kin, and a special poster to commemorate the evening.</p><p>From those exciting panels and meet and greets to celebrity photo ops and live entertainment – Wizard World continues to set itself apart from the other conventions out there. We spoke with CEO John Maatta in St. Louis this year and he discussed plans the con had to continue focusing on a fan-driven experience. It’s not just about bringing in numbers with Wizard, it’s about making a lasting impact on each and every person who walks into the convention hall.</p><p>With unique moments, like a pizza party and card game night, to live music and a stage for creativity &nbsp; – there are elements of the pop culture experience that you will only find at Wizard World. Oh, and that’s without mentioning the incredible cosplay you’ll certainly see.</p><p>Wizard still has six shows through the remainder of 2018, including stops in Tulsa, Sacramento, and Montgomery.
