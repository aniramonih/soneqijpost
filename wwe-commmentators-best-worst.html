Currently working on the announce table for NXT as well as other MMA and kickboxing promotions, he brings an intensity to any wrestling encounter, selling the crucial moments and cultivating hype.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, Ranallo's time with WWE hasn't been plain sailing. The former SmackDown announcer went on hiatus in 2007 following issues with his mental health that were alleged to be the fault of John 'Bradshaw' Layfield - <a href=#>though these claims have since been disputed</a>.</p><h2 id=worst-renee-young><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Worst: Renee Young</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Renee-Young.jpg><p>Renee Young is a bubbly and vibrant personality, a welcome addition to the WWE roster. It is a shame that this doesn't translate well on commentary, as the Canadian announcer has been criticized by fans for sounding too robotic and lifeless on commentary.</p><p>Young often sounds as if she is reading from a script, which given WWE's strange policies, might be true. Moreover, the bickering between her and Corey Graves if often more distracting than it is entertaining.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=best-paul-heyman><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Best: Paul Heyman</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Paul-Heyman.jpg><p>Paul Heyman is one of the greatest talkers in WWE, period. The former ECW commentator currently features as the advocate for Brock Lesnar, a role he thrives in. He can work a crowd and hype a match purely with the decibel levels of his voice.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 TNA Factions We Completely Forgot About</a></span></p><p>Heyman defined Extreme Championship Wrestling and was an entertaining presence throughout the Invasion storyline. His exchanges with Jim Ross remain highlights in the company's history, both of them iconic voices on the mic.</p><h2 id=worst-michael-cole><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Worst: Michael Cole</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Michael-Cole-Byron-Saxton-Corey-Graves.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Michael Cole is a long-serving commentator for WWE, though unlike other long-term voices such as Paul Heyman and Jim Ross, he has annoyed the crowd as opposed to earning their respect. The former journalist currently works on commentary for Raw and other pay-per-view events.</p><p>Cole did some good work as a heel from 2010 to 2012, wrestling sporadically and feuding with fellow announcer Jerry Lawler. It was a good decision as fans had already expressed a lack of enthusiasm for his commentary - or the emphatic way he pronounces the name of the company.</p><h2 id=best-vince-mcmahon><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Best: Vince McMahon</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Vince-McMahon-Jerry-Lawler.jpg><p>Believer it or not, the chairman and CEO of WWE once worked on the commentary table. And he did an excellent job of it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before taking over the reins of the company from his father Vincent McMahon Jr. in 1982, the third-generation wrestling promotor made his debut as an in-ring announcer for WWWF's All-Star Wrestling in 1969. From there, he spent a large portion of his career working on the commentary table, where he did a good job branding his voice with the company's image and reputation.</p><h2 id=worst-jerry-lawler><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Worst: Jerry Lawler</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jerry-Lawler.jpg><p>Jerry Lawler fits the Attitude Era perfectly. His lewd, brash and often vulgar commentary -particularly whenever Trish Stratus was in the ring - fit the tone of the controversial period in WWE's history, an era remembered for its provocative content.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This hasn't aged well, however. In a post Women's Evolution and PG era WWE, Lawler has had much of his personality on the mic stripped and comes across as tired and deflated. His effectiveness as an announcer has faded, and his most successful current work is arguably his in-ring talk segments.</p><h2 id=best-jim-ross><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Best: Jim Ross</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jim-Ross.jpg><p>Jim Ross is a wrestling legend. His voice is legendary and he has worked on commentary for pivotal moments in WWE history, clashing well with other voices such as Jerry Lawler and Vince McMahon. He is currently signed with All Elite Wrestling, providing a legendary voice on commentary for what could be WWE's biggest competitor.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 5 Best Wrestlers Jim Ross Found For The WWE (& The 5 Worst)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ross departed WWE in 2013, though later went on to provide commentary on the independent circuit and for New Japan Pro Wrestling. He returned to WWE in 2017, providing commentary for WrestleMania 33's main event No Holds Barred Match between Roman Reigns and The Undertaker. He worked alongside Lita for the Mae Young Classic, though elected not to renew his contract in March 2019.</p><h2 id=worst-byron-saxton><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Worst: Byron Saxton</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Byron-Saxton.jpg><p>Byron Saxton was once a professional wrestler signed with WWE, appearing in Florida Championship Wrestling and later the fourth season of NXT. Despite being eliminated, Saxton returned for the fifth season as a heel before being eliminated once again. When developmental was rebranded, he made his return as an in-ring announcer and later moved to the main roster where he works on the commentary table.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like Michael Cole, Saxton has been criticized by fans for his lackluster presence and boring commentary. Following in the footsteps of talents like Jim Ross is no easy feat, as the bar has been set high.</p><h2 id=best-cm-punk><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Best: CM Punk</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/CM-Punk-The-Rock-Daniel-Bryan.jpg><p>CM Punk had a brief but bright run on commentary. The former WWE Champion remains one of the greatest voices on the microphone in WWE history, and it is&nbsp;easy to see why he excelled when working on the announce table.</p><p>The Straight Edge Superstar had sporadic appearances on commentary in 2010, providing his voice for matches featured on Raw and NXT. His witty comebacks and analysis were arguably as entertaining as the wrestling.</p><h2 id=worst-stephanie-mcmahon><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Worst: Stephanie McMahon</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Stephanie-McMahon-Womens-Roster.jpg><p>Stephanie McMahon made a guest appearance on commentary for the first-ever Women's Royal Rumble match in 2018. Many fans criticized her for once again interjecting herself in the biggest moments of the Women's Evolution without preamble, as her presence added nothing to the energy of the announce table.</p><p>The Billion Dollar Princess, though a good heel presence on the mic, had little gusto throughout the match. A good thing, perhaps, as the moment was significant enough with some quality wrestling and guest appearances in the ring.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>5 Times Seth Rollins Was The Most Successful Shield Member ( & 5 Times It Was Roman Reigns)</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmenp7K0wMuipaBnp6yybq%2FOpqSmnZ6prrW70axkm52jqXq4u9Gsq2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10-fastest-production-cars-world.html><span>←</span><span>The 10 Fastest Production Cars In The World</span></a>
