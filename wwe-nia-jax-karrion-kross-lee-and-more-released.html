WWE Hall of Famer Mick Foley mentioned that WWE missed out on the hottest acts in the business.</p><p>“So Karrion Kross and Scarlett Bordeaux get to be a duo again – and whoever picks them up has one of the hottest acts in the biz. Unfortunately, it seems WWE is sometimes intent on trying to reinvent the wheel” – tweet Foley.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Keith Lee is also a former NXT Champion. He was recently repackaged and introduced as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Bearcat” Lee</a>. It seemed like WWE had big plans for him and his release came as the biggest shock.

WWE was really adamant about getting all their employees and talents vaccinated – keeping in mind everyone’s well-being. But Jax decision on remaining unvaccinated led to her release from the company.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Nia Jax was last seen on Raw, when she was brutally attacked by her Tag Team partner <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shayna Baszler</a>.
