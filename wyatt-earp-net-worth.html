Corral during which lawmen killed three outlaw Cowboys. He is often regarded as the central figure in the shootout in Tombstone, although his brother Virgil was Tombstone City Marshal and Deputy U.S. Marshal that day, and had far more experience as a sheriff, constable, marshal, and soldier in combat. Earp lived a restless life. He was at different times in his life a city policeman, county sheriff, teamster, buffalo hunter, bouncer, saloon-keeper, gambler, brothel owner, pimp, miner, and boxing referee. Earp spent his early life in Iowa. His first wife Urilla Sutherland Earp died while pregnant less than a year after they married. Within the next two years he was arrested, sued twice, escaped from jail, then was arrested three more times for "keeping and being found in a house of ill-fame". He landed in the cattle boomtown of Wichita, Kansas, where he became a deputy city marshal for one year and developed a solid reputation as a lawman. In 1876 he followed his brother James to Dodge City, Kansas, where he became an assistant city marshal. In winter 1878, he went to Texas to gamble where he met John Henry "Doc" Holliday, whom Earp credited with saving his life.Earp moved constantly throughout his life from one boomtown to another. He left Dodge City in 1879 and with his brothers James and Virgil, moved to Tombstone, where a silver boom was underway. The Earps bought an interest in the Vizina mine and some water rights. There, the Earps clashed with a loose federation of outlaws known as the Cowboys. Wyatt, Virgil, and their younger brother Morgan held various law enforcement positions that put them in conflict with Tom and Frank McLaury, and Ike and Billy Clanton, who threatened to kill the Earps. The conflict escalated over the next year, culminating on October 26, 1881 in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, in which the Earps and Holliday killed three of the Cowboys. In the next five months, Virgil was ambushed and maimed, and Morgan was assassinated. Pursuing a vendetta, Wyatt, his brother Warren, Holliday, and others formed a federal posse that killed three of the Cowboys they thought responsible. Unlike his lawmen brothers Virgil and James, and Doc Holliday, Wyatt was never wounded in any of the gunfights, which only added to his mystique after his death.Wyatt was a lifelong gambler and was always looking for a quick way to make money. After meeting again in San Francisco, Earp and his third wife Josephine Earp joined a gold rush to Eagle City, Idaho, where they had mining interests and a saloon. They left there to race horses and open a saloon during a real estate boom in San Diego, California. Back in San Francisco, Wyatt raced horses again, but his reputation suffered irreparably when he refereed the Fitzsimmons-Sharkey boxing mat ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=26.117647058824><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Wyatt Earp</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$11 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>1962</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Died</td><td>January 13, 1929, Los Angeles, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Perkins, Oklahoma, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.83&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>Occupation</td><td>Gambler, lawman, buffalo hunter, saloon keeper, bouncer, gold and copper miner, pimp, boxing referee</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Profession</td><td>Sheriff, Gunfighter, Official, Miner, Hunter, Gambler</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Spouse</td><td>Josephine Earp, Mattie Blaylock, Urilla Sutherland</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>none, None</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Nicholas Porter Earp, Virginia Ann Cooksey</td></tr><tr readability=11><td>Siblings</td><td>Virgil Earp, Morgan Earp, Warren Earp, James Earp, Newton Earp, Adelia Douglas Earp, Martha Elizabeth Earp, Virginia Ann Earp, Mariah Ann Earp</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Nicknames</td><td>69, Wyatt Earp, Earp, Wyatt</td></tr><tr readability=0.23529411764706><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://imdb.com/name/nm0247449</a></td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Nominations</td><td>Academy Award for Best Cinematography, People's Choice Award for Favorite Dramatic Movie Actor, American Society of Cinematographers Award for Outstanding Achievement in Cinematography in Theatrical Releases</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=0.86842105263158><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=1.7183098591549><td>1</td><td>He is a distant relative of 19th century historical figure <a href=#>Wyatt Earp</a>.</td></tr></table><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/networthpost.org/wp-content/themes/net-worth/images/celebrity_net_worth.png><h3 class=toggle-head>Actor <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=actor readability=1><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Grace of the Gun</td><td>2010</td><td>Short</td><td>Narrator (voice)</td></tr><tr><td>Sordid Lives: The Series</td><td>2008</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Sheriff Danford</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Pretty Ugly People</td><td>2008</td><td></td><td>Airport Announcer (voice)</td></tr><tr><td>Tombstone</td><td>1993</td><td></td><td>Billy Claiborne</td></tr><tr><td>Angel Fire</td><td>1992</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=2><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>The Making of 'Tombstone'</td><td>2002</td><td>Video documentary short</td><td>Himself - 'Billy Claiborne' (as Wyatt Earp III)</td></tr></table><h3>Known for movies</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritypictures.org/thumbs/0247449/0247449_1.jpeg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movies/thumbs/247449_Wyatt-Earp/247449_Tombstone-1993.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movies/thumbs/247449_Wyatt-Earp/247449_Pretty-Ugly-People-2008.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movies/thumbs/247449_Wyatt-Earp/247449_Sordid-Lives-The-Series-2008.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqecrWWnpL%2B1tI6wsJqspGKyor7PZqWerF2svLPAx2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./moses-j-moseley.html><span>←</span><span>Who was Moses J Moseley?
